Mixing it up with the occasional run along the west-side highway does a girl good. But one thing that I’ve learned is most important? Really getting in a good stretch before and after a workout. It completely leans you out, and elongates you. Plus, it feels really good. Stretching is just as serious as my activewear. I’ve just stocked up on new gear from Lord & Taylor. Calvin Klein Performance, along with Under Armor, to name a few of my favorite brands. I love a soft palette for the gym. Greys, blacks, and neutral tie-dyes, along with a stellar pair of kicks. I kicked off the new year fresh with a good yoga session on my front porch back in California. This year is all about being stronger, healthier, and a lot more zen.\n\nLord & Taylor:\n-Under Armor hat\n-Calvin Klein Performance bra\n=Calvin Klein Performance yoga pants and jacket\n-Michael Kors sneakers ",

Within today's outfit I want to present you a piece out of the Vans x Disney collection, which I'm absolutely crazy for..\n\n\nI mean, seriously, shy should only kids enjoy the colorful and happy world of Disney. One is only as old as one feel , isn't it?\n\n\n\nI think in general, we deal too much about what people think about us in person and how we act or what we wear, even we set a lot of pressure on ourselves for no obvious reason.\n\n\n\nWhen I saw this lovely grey sweater with the pink Minnie mouse on the front side, I knew this one was made for me. I couldn't wait for the next day to try it and of course to share it with you. As I think, this look doesn't look childish or strange at all and I really like this style on me and that is and should always be the only thing that matters.\n\n\n\n\nI think Vans did a great job by including Disney in the collection and also the pieces for next season, which I already had a preview at during the German press days, is going to be something. Get ready for some great fun with Vans.\n\n",

      "text":"New Year’s Resolution: return to the Motherland.\n\nI like to think that I don’t dwell on past events or hold grudges… with the exception of Sammy in Year 2 who made fun of my 糟菜粉干 lunch - it tasted so much better than your Wonder White and Kraft peanut butter, you asshole (#asiankidproblems).* Once in a while, usually on a long-haul flight, something will trigger a memory of pronouncing “Niger” incorrectly in Year 5 geography class, or a contact lens falling out in the middle of a speech in front of the whole school, and I’ll spend the next three hours systematically working my way through every mortifying moment in my lifetime until I feel like the entire plane is judging me.\nAside from that, I feel like I’m a pretty forward-thinking person.\nNO RAGRETS.\nAnd yet, my one genuine source of recurring regret is not having spent more time with my extended family in China. Growing up, we returned to the Motherland once every couple of years, which was certainly not often enough (nor did we stay long enough) to be treated as anything but disproportionately important guests. Asian sisters in the room (or any family-based culture, for that matter) – you know how it is. Being force fed the home-cooking so good that you want to vomit, bruised cheeks from elderly pinching with bonus running commentary on how “fat” you are and don’t forget the violent battle for the cheque at the end of a meal at a restaurant.\nOver the course of my travelling career, my body has associated particular sensory experiences with particular continents. In Europe, I feel like my chest is wide open, my breathing deepens and slows down, I’m constantly looking up in awe of the architectural history and I see colours in periodically relevant music (hot tip: walking around the white hills of Granada with Granados playing in your ears is the closest you’ll ever be to any kind of bizarro enlightenment people claim to reach). Every Asian city I’ve worked in over the past four years has had a similar effect of stirring sensory memories I built between ages 7 and 16: the weird contrast between beautiful weathered old women with a tonne of corn attached to their bike and the youth’s hyper-reliance on technology, the blur of sewerage and Arctic air-conditioning, the simultaneous mass obsession and rejection of Western culture and commerce. You definitely internalise to cope with the clockwork masses. And you definitely try not to breathe the smog and secondary cigarette smoke.\nA 48 hour work stint in Hong Kong last month (during which these shots and elaborate tripod selfies were taken – more on that later) definitely reignited all of the above. The last time I was in China, I was hiking in 四川, with numb toes from the December freeze, and a numb mouth from the famous provincial chillies I overzealously consumed with every meal. The time before that, this website didn’t even exist, and Justin Bieber still had a bowl cut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeam me up.\nAsilio Camisole - MANGO Aviator Bomber Jacket - Camilla and Marc Arion Pants - Alexander Wang Andie Calf Hair Wedge Boots - Vintage Scarf\n*admittedly, I asked Mum to buy me Uncle Toby’s Fruit Roll-Ups and string cheese sticks the next day.

Working independently requires a lot of self discipline and structure and now that I'm back to working from home I have to make an effort to reinstate some of my previous structure.\nI've been really good about getting up and going swimming but on the days where I'm feeling less like a mermaid, I'm getting moving outside or in a traditional gym. I needed some new cute clothes for the occasion and this Addition Elle fleece lined hoodie was perfect for keeping warm on those out door days.

      "text":"\nAfter my house is clean, my laundry done and my meals planned for the next week, I finally have the head space to think about how I want to improve myself for the next year. I like the idea of resolutions. Sure - we may not keep all of them, or any of them, but it’s still nice to have some conscious goals to work towards in the name of self improvement. \nLISTENING\nI’m trying a lot harder to do less talking about myself (when I’m nervous, it’s easy to do) and instead hear more of what others are saying. Asking open ended questions “how did you do that?” or “tell me more about that” are helping me in this arena. I think I’m a pretty extroverted person, but I sometimes feel really awkward in social situations (read: nervous blabbering mentioned above). \nMAKE ME TIME COUNT (or less reality tv & mindless social media)\nUhhh. I watch way too much TV, especially at night after Felix goes to bed. I’m usually in relaxation mode and don’t want to work on the blog so it’s easy to just plop onto the couch and turn on The Bachelor (ok ok ok, I’m still going to watch it, it’s just reruns on E!, HGTV and The Food Network that I need to cool my jets on) I also think this would be a great time to get back into reading, something I admittedly haven’t done at all since Felix was born. \nAnd like most people on the planet, I spend too much time on my phone which doesn’t really increase my overall happiness more than anything I could be doing instead. I want to cut that addiction and really limit my facebook and instagram scrolling (I’ll probably narrow them down as well). I think an alarm clock in the bedroom instead of having my phone in there will curb my scrolling time too. On that note, if there’s ever something you absolutely want/need a personal answer for, email is the best way to reach me! \nTWO MINUTE RULE\nThis is one I mentioned yesterday and from last year’s resolutions. When I’m on it, it really works. In short - if there’s a task that can be completed in less than two minutes - do it now. And trust me - there are a lot of things that can be scratched off your list in that amount of time! Picking up toys, vacuuming, switching over the laundry, emptying the dishwasher, etc. Just carrying a load of whatever up or down the stairs on my way makes everything a little more settled. \nACCENTUATE THE POSITIVE\nEliminate the negative. Embrace the affirmative. And don’t mess with Mr. Inbetween. \nHappy New Year! ",

      "text":"Growing up and living in Los Angeles with hundreds of restaurants and food options just minutes away, eating out or delivery dinners were the norm, but since moving up to the mountains, where our choices have diminished, we actually use our kitchen and eat in nearly every day of the week now, which I love. The chillier winter months also keep us indoors more, and since our kitchen is part of our living room, or great room, it’s always in view… which has its pros and cons.\nI love that everyone’s always in the same space. I don’t love that it’s not entirely my dream kitchen and there are so many things I’d like to change {which I notice every time I’m in the space}. So I’ve partnered with the NEW Signature Kitchen Suite to get a start on making my dream kitchen come to life one appliance at a time.\nThis is my kitchen…\nAnd while I’ve really made it work with our space, decoratively speaking, it’s nowhere near my dream kitchen, though I feel wildly lucky to have such a large and open space to cook in and to share with friends and family, because it’s the kitchen where we always end up, and I love that.\nBut let me just start by saying that every single major appliance in my kitchen is made by a different brand. None match. NOT. A. ONE. And let me also just say that it kind of DRIVES ME INSANE. But what really gets my blood boiling {yes, I know, dramatic, but you type A’s will understand} is that all of the appliances are stainless steal… all of them EXCEPT THE BUILT IN DOUBLE OVEN… which is black. Why? Who Does this?\nIt’s clear that the kitchen was renovated before we bought the house, so you’d think that all the appliances would match. But no. And while I do actually LOVE the layout of the kitchen, I’d REALLY LOVE to renovate it one day so that I could call it my own… because the potential for it to be my dream kitchen is so close — but OH so far away.\nBut before a total renovation is necessary, I think there is one simple thing that could make me happy with my kitchen, and that is swapping out the current, mismatched oven for this DREAMY Signature Kitchen Suite Double Wall Oven because IT. IS. PERFECT.\nJust look at how beautiful it is… and how it would really finish my kitchen so nicely. I’m telling you, I’ve never wanted a kitchen appliance more than I want this double oven in that wall of my house.\nIt even has Smart Functionality – Through Wi-Fi connectivity with SmartThinQ™, so you can stay in touch with it through a mobile device. At the push of a button, you can preheat appliances remotely, ensure ovens are turned off, receive push notifications if any issues arise, and even report errors straight to the industry leading personal Kitchen Concierge™. I mean, how amazing is that?\nThis beautiful masterpiece of an oven is part of the NEW Signature Kitchen Suite brand that was just launched at the Kitchen, Bath and Industry Show (KBIS) in Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 19, 2016, and every super-premium appliance in the suite from dishwasher to refrigerator to microwave, is stunning.\nAt the show, three experts designed three personalized kitchen vignettes in what they call The Signature Style House. The creativity and passion that each expert brought to their kitchen design, paired with the elegant design and advanced technology of the Signature Kitchen Suite appliances, created a space and experience that was truly unique and unforgettable. Bosworth and Ambrose were also on-site to reveal their individual Signature Kitchen Suites, and chat with attendees about what they created. The event also included a live demo from an award-winning celebrity chef, Marcus Samuelsson. It sounds like it was amazing!\nFashion stylist June Ambrose, left, and lifestyle expert Lo Bosworth  celebrate the launch of Signature Kitchen Suite at the Kitchen and Bath Industry Show in Las Vegas on January 19, 2016, at Las Vegas Convention Center.

(Photo by Bizuayehu Tesfaye/AP Images for Signature Kitchen Suite)\nWould I swap nearly every appliance in my kitchen for Signature Kitchen Suite so that they all matched perfectly giving my kitchen a luxurious, custom look? Ab-so-lutely. Yes. 100%\nThe sleek dishwasher, with its LoDecibel™ Quiet Operation and TurboWash™ technology would be next on my list of upgrades because not only is the latch on mine broken, it takes FOREVER and is RIDICULOUSLY LOUD too. This Signature Suite dishwasher enables more powerful washing and cycles that take less time to complete running at only 40 decibels. Faster AND quieter? Yes. Please.\nBut honestly, I would be jumping for joy to simply replace the one very mismatched double wall oven for the sleek new Signature Kitchen Suite Double Wall Oven because it would make me and my kitchen complete… for now anyway.\nI mean… It’s perfect. And I need it.\nWhat one thing would make your kitchen so much better?\nJoin the conversation using the hashtag #NoOrdinaryKitchen or visit Signature Kitchen Suite on Facebook and Instagram.\n* This post is brought to you by Signature Kitchen Suite.

As for most of you who know a substantial list of under-$100 bags is feasible but are savvy enough to remember that no one said anything about those bags being chic, cute, covetable, or remotely expensive-looking, well, here’s one to change your mind! We’ve scoured all the stores to find a tightly edited group of 10 bags that are all that and more. Long live the frugal Snobs in all of us!\n1. Croft Bag: Inexpensive doesn’t mean you have no choice but to go for a youthful vibe. Solid structure and ladylike design speak of nothing but polish. I can see this dangling from Taylor Swift’s delicate arm. At Need Supply Co. for $68.\n2. & Other Stories Leather Bowling Bag: I love the tough-meets-sweet color combo of black and pale pink, and this daily bowling bag will never go out of style. At & Other Stories for $59 (from $195).\n3. & Other Stories Small Faux Snake Shoulder Bag: Nothing like a little bit of red snakeskin (So what if it’s faux? We can’t carry real python all the time) to turn the attitude of your outfit up a few notches. At & Other Stories for $53 (from $175).\n4. & Other Stories Faux Shearling and Leather Clutch: H&M offshoot & Other Stories does it again with the perfect rugged winter clutch. They’ve also managed to make a functional wristlet strap look cool, thanks to the symmetrical placement. At & Other Stories for $43 (from $85).\n5. Adidas by Stella McCartney Canvas Gym Bag: We love a gym bag that can double as a casual weekender or a sporty carryon and this roomy canvas tote does that and more. On MATCHESFASHION.com for $53 (from $76).\n6. The Cambridge Satchel ‘The Tiny’ Crossbody Bag: It may have had a big moment last year, but have no doubt: the Cambridge Satchel’s bags are still a strong frugal staple. On Farfetch for $100.51.\n7. Soeur Sac 3 Tote: Snap up this summery woven north-south tote, priced nicely under a hundred bucks, and make like you picked it up on your last jaunt to St. Bart’s. At Barneys New York for $95.\n8. Nasty Gal Passing the Bucket Bag: Consider this little dark cherry-colored treat your companion when you’re ready to have a rowdy night out – and you don’t want to destroy one of your more investment-ready favorites. At Nasty Gal for $38.\n9. Zara Mini Embossed City Bag: Zara has done it again: They’ve produced a bag that’s not only eerily reminiscent of much higher end variation but one that looks just as great. At Zara for $40 (from $70).\n10. Rebecca Minkoff Leo Striped Faux Leather Envelope Clutch: Last but not least, no frugal find list would be complete without Rebecca Minkoff. I love this slim envelope clutch for its sleek design and amped-up stripes. At Saks Fifth Avenue for $95.",

      "text":"\nI’ve been promising to do an updated beauty routine post for a while…here it is! It’s always so hard to condense a beauty post. I’m a beauty junkie, so I’m sorry in advance if this runs long! Not all of the products I’m going to mention are pictured (some of my more well-loved makeup is too far gone to photograph) but I will include links to all. I’ll do a night time routine soon as well!\nSKINCARE:\nEvery morning I wash my face using a gritty washcloth with Fresh Soy Cleanser. Then I apply Dear By Tone Up Booskin toner with a cotton pad, and follow up by massaging a few drops of Hylamide Glow Serum into my face. This serum builds up a very subtle natural glow in your skin. I get pasty in the winter,  so I love how this brings the life back to my complexion. If I have time in the morning, I like to do a Korean sheet mask before I get ready. Before I begin my makeup, I completely saturate my skinwith moisture by using a lot of face cream. Right now I love Dr. Jart’s Cermadin cream. It makes a great base for makeup and protects my skin when we are out shooting on freezing cold mornings! For SPF, I’ve been using MISSHA’s waterproof sun milk for years now. It is very light and non-greasy. If I am having a breakout, I apply this acne serum to help clear it up faster.\nPRIMER:\nI always start my makeup with Bare Minerals Skin Revver-Upper. It has glycolic and salicylic acid in it that plump up your skin instantly. I must warn you, it smells a little weird! If I have a long day of shooting ahead, I will also use Hourglass’s Mineral Veil Primer. This makes your makeup waterproof, so it has major lasting power, even through rain or working out.\nFOUNDATION:\nI use a few foundations on a rotating basis, but here are my favorites. My current favorite is CoverFx’s Custom Cover Drops. This is a concentrated foundation serum that is meant to be mixed with skin care. As a skin care freak, this is a dream come true! I mix mine with a drop of a honey skin oil and apply it with a stippling brush. Mixed with oil, this gives the dewiest skin ever. Huge fan of this!\nI also use Bare Minerals broad spectrum foundation in Fair very regularly. I’ve been using Bare Minerals since I was 13, I’m still in love with it! It photographs beautifully up close and its never cakey. If I have any sort of breakout going on, this is the foundation I’m using.\nCONCEALER, BRONZER, AND LUMINZER:\nI’ve recently discovered Benefit’s Erase Paste…best under eye concealer ever! It’s a salmon tinted concealer to color-correct under eye circles. It is very emollient and goopy, so a little goes a long way.\nI love the look of super glowy skin, and as I recently mentioned on Instagram, BECCA cosmetic’s Shimmering Skin Perfector Poured is insane! I put this on underneath my foundation because the glow is pretty intense. I use the color Moonstone. I like to bronze up my temples and the hollows of my cheeks with Becca’s Lowlight/Highlight pallette. Even on someone as pale as me, this looks very natural and subtle.\n\nEYES AND BROWS:\nI use mostly cream eyeshadows, and ever since I bought Charlotte Tilbury’s Eyes to Mesmerize cream shadow I am hooked. I love the shades Jean and Marie Antoinette, I use them every day as a base for whatever eyeshadow I’m doing. The four-quad eyeshadow palette pictured above is Charlotte Tilbury’s Vintage Vamp palette. I love a rose smokey eye.\nI am obsessed with Marc Jacob’s Velvet Noir mascara right now. One coat gets me where I want my eyelashes to be. It is also intensely black in color. I don’t usually wear false eyelashes but I hoard them in my makeup bag for some strange reason. The ones pictured here are super cheap and amazing from Liftly.\nI just found my holy grail brow product in Dior’s Brow Styler Ultra Fine Precision Pencil. This pencil is so incredibly fine! It makes every stroke look like real brow hairs. I have tried everything for eyebrows, and this is my favorite.\nLIPS AND CHEEKS:\nI only own a few lipsticks because I am pretty picky about them. One I always use is Chanel’s Rouge Coco in 418 Misia. This is one of those colors that would suit anyone! I never apply from the tube, I tap it on as a sheer stain with my fingers. Favorite lipstick ever. I also recently ordered LadyKin’s One Touch Bling Glow Lipstick in Fall Rose and fell in love with the color and formula. It’s also only six dollars, so that’s a bonus.\nI never wear just one shade of blush…I usually mix about three and put them in different places around my temples and cheeks. I’m obsessed with Narsissist Cheek Studio for this reason! The colors are to die for! Also obsessed with Becca’s Beach Tint Shimmer Souffle in Guava. This is the perfect natural flush/skin luminizer.\n\n\nAbove are a few recent acquisitions worth mentioning that I’ve added to my say time skin routine….\nClockwise from top left: SNP Advanced Peeling Gel , Etude House Cotton Fit BB Cream, Velvet 59 Exotic Lotus eyeshadow palette\nHolika Holika Real Skin Finish primer, Mizon King to the Kong moist cream, Murad Acne Spot Fast Fix, Etude House Age Firming Cream",

      "text":"Around here, we love any excuse to turn everyday chores into extraordinary occasions – especially around the holidays. This time of year is all about bringing loved ones together, so why not turn even present-wrapping into a party?!\nGrowing up, our mother attended an annual gift-wrapping event with her friends. It was an all day affair: come when you can, bring gifts to wrap, and enjoy a few hours of laughter, music, and great conversation. Inspired by this memory, we threw our very own Wrap Party last week – complete with a plethora of craft supplies and plenty of Ecco Domani wine. In collaboration with our girlfriends, we’ve compiled our 10 favorite DIY gift-wrapping ideas from the day. We hope they will inspire you to throw together your own wrappin’ and happenin’ this year!\n\nWHAT YOU’LL NEED: a serious assortment of wine, plus wrapping paper, ribbons, and greenery to play with. Have each of your guests bring one item to contribute to the crafting – the conflux of unexpected materials will definitely yield new heights of creativity!\n1. Skip the bow and infuse a natural element by tying in a few flowers or leaves. Pick up a bouquet from your local florist to play with, or simply clip them from your own garden.\n2. Save any branches that have fallen from your tree and spray paint them gold for a beautiful and surprisingly simple topper.\n3. Upgrade white craft paper with watercolors. You can make a clean, graphic pattern, or just swirl it all together for an abstract moment.\n4. If you aren’t quite as artistically inclined, just take those watercolors and splatter paint your gift. This one was FUN!\n5. Keep the paint game going with cute polka dot patterns. Use a small paint brush or even the end of a pencil eraser to maintain consistent sizing.\n6. Recycle your old newspapers for a nostalgic twist. It’s also a cute surprise to fill your box with newsprint snowflakes in lieu of tissue paper.\n7. Glue glitter or confetti to upgrade a simple gift box, or use it to trim your tags.\n8. For a playful alternative to your basic bow, accordion-fold some of your leftover paper clippings for a bowtie-like effect, or spiral your gift in pom-pom-lined twine.\n9. You can never go wrong with a classic, oversized silk bow.\n10. For those who haven’t finished their holiday shopping yet, always provide an alternative activity. Gingerbread decorating is oh-so fun and something everyone can bring home to surprise the ones they love. Now pour yourself a glass of wine and have a very happy holiday season!\nPHOTOS| by Lindsay Brown",

We don’t, so we thought about all the products we love and can fit in our gym bag to use before and after our workout. Some of them are real game changers!\nBEFORE\nThe secret to feeling comfortable is to arrive prepared. To do that, you just need a few specific products: deodorant, dry shampoo (to prevent hair from sticking too much after the workout) and sunscreen if you are outdoors (yes, even in the winter). The true highlight to add to the selection is a gel to prepare the muscles: trust us, you will thank us later. Don’t forget to take your makeup off, skin tends to get irritated when you sweat during a workout and some makeup components might alter, changing their color.\nAFTER\nTo recover from your exercize, pamper yourself. If you shower at the gym, choose a shower gel with an energizing fragrance or a toning body scrub. If, instead, you prefer to relax, the best choice would be a warm bath with salts and essential oils, which are also very nourishing. Once you get out of the bathtub, accurately dab your skin and, then, move to the toning phase! The latest products on the market will help you extend the beneficial effects of the workout even out of the gym. For an ultra-quick absorption, that will guarantee undamaged clothes, we suggest light oil formulas. In our gallery you’ll find our favorite ones. Try them; you won’t be able to live without anymore!\nBEFORE: make sure you smell great with Lavanila - Sport Luxe Deodorant",

I have been enjoying some days at home catching up on a ton of work before Fashion Week, which is exactly what I need to do, collect my thoughts and get organised. Some trips are in the process of getting materialised, which lights up my mood like you cannot believe. So many changes this year and it’s starting out with a bang!.

Past Mulholland drive onto Wonderland Drive, there lies one of Pierre Koenig’s case study houses: the Bailey House – a literal time capsule of of the 60’s. It is mod-minimalism at it’s finest. Encapsulated in the space – beyond the obvious design and Jetsonian appliances – is a feeling of hope. A hope for a simpler future where style and utility could be married.

I took a little break from the blog over Christmas to spend some time with my family, stock up on inspiration and finish decorating my apartment. So, today I thought I’d share a little sneak peek of my dining area, or more importantly, my new gorgeous chairs!\nI have dreamt about these Fritz Hansen chairs for ages and when we bought our new apartment, they were the first thing I ordered. The delivery time for these beauties was quite long (about 8 weeks) but let me tell you, they were well worth the wait. I went back and forth with the color choice but finally decided to mix it up a bit and ordered them in white, black and grey and I absolutely love the result!\nMixing chairs is a fun & easy way to spice up your dining area, but to pull it off, consistency is key. Always make sure the chairs have one element in common – shape, hue or material. If you’re mixing chairs with completely different shapes, stick to one color or material to keep the look harmonious. Or, do like me and go for chairs in the same style but pick a different color for each chair to add some drama!\nCHAIRS Fritz Hansen ‘Grand Prix’ / Nordiska Galleriet. TABLE HAY ‘Loop Stand‘.

We spent one weekend in New York before flying to LA, San Fran and now road tripping down Highway 1 along the beautiful Big Sur. This is just a quick update from my favourite season and place, Fall in NYC.\nHow to get there: I flew with Cathay Pacific from Sydney to New York JFK, via Hong Kong. It is one of the longest flights possible (making the most of sleep!) and I prefer not having to stopover in LA for customs and baggage.\nWhere to stay: I stayed downtown NYC in TriBeCa for the first time, at the Smyth, A Thompson Hotel. Their suite was one of the biggest spaces I’ve experienced in NYC, with an incredible vine covered terrace with views.\nWhere to eat:\nJack’s Wife Freda has always been a favourite of mine. They recently opened a location on Carmine Street in the West Village as well as their original spot on Lafayette in Soho. My favourites on the menu are Maya’s Grain Bowl, the Rosewater Waffles and Nana tea.\nThe Butcher’s Daughter on Kenmare Street is known for a delicious, and mostly vegan menu that always helps in my jet lag recovery. I always get the Red Juice and Spicy Kale Caesar Salad.\nThe Momofuku Ramen from Momofuku Noodle Bar is my favourite dish in the world. I often joke that I could eat Ramen all day every day, especially for breakfast… so you can imagine how many different Ramen’s I’ve tried the world over. Make sure to get there early as there can be a long line. Try the pork buns too!\nWhat to see and do:\nCentral Park is definitely the most beautiful during Fall. The leaves change colour seemingly overnight after a cold snap, and transform the park in to a multicoloured wonderland. I get a picnic lunch from Whole Foods at Columbus Circle and sit on the hill above the Duck Pond, overlooking the trees and city.\nMake the most of the Brooklyn Flea Markets over the weekend before the weather gets too cold. Wander with a hot apple cider, and if it isn’t too windy take the ferry down the East River back to Manhattan.\nPhotos by Nicole Cooper",

During the same period, Louis XIV gathered the nation’s most talented artists and culturally exciting figures at the court of Versailles. Today, in 2015, Martell — the oldest of the great cognac Houses — pays tribute to this heritage with the launch of the Martell France 300 project.\nIn association with L’Officiel Paris and led by the gorgeous actress Diane Kruger (who is also the Tricentenaire Ambassador), Martell reveals the 300 most influential talents (art, fashion, entertainment, gastronomy and mixology) who best represents the French Art de Vivre in the 21st century. Photographer Patrick Demarchelier, fashion designer Joseph Altuzarra and blogger Garance Dore are included in the list.\nFor video interviews on some of the most exciting innovative French talents and to experience your own French Art de Vivre, visit www.Martell.com/France300.\nPhoto via Mary McCartney",

      "text":"Maxie's posts is spot on today. One of the hardest things that I had to figure out when I quit the rowing team in college was what my morning routine would be. For years I had been waking up extra early to rush to get to school (that 7:25am start always felt terrible) or rushing out the door before the crack of dawn to get to practice. Once I quit though, I had luxurious mornings to fill up. Even my earliest class at 8:50am felt incredibly late. The first few weeks I slept in, but I'd find myself groggy. Then I started to work in a morning routine and it changed how my entire day went. With my first job in NYC, I had a strict morning routine that really set how my whole day would go. I needed that rhythm to get me going! Even working from home, I stick to a routine. I swear by it!\n\n\nHow to Create a Morning Routine You Stick to in 2016\nGuest post by Maxie McCoy\nThe way you start your day sets the entire tone of the day. Think about all the days you’ve snoozed seventy times only to rush around like a mad person. Or the countless mornings you’ve laid scrolling in bed, waist deep in facebook and Instagram and emails and snaps and texts. Thirty minutes later you’re almost late for class or work and didn’t have time to fuel your body. I know. Been there. So guilty. That used to be so me. \nAnd then a few years ago I got the wild idea to stop pushing emails right to my phone so that I didn’t have to see everything waiting for me from the time I turned my alarm off. Or in the middle of the night when I woke up for some reason.  It was an amazing change because I finally was able to erase my morning anxiety. My chest didn’t tighten within 5 minutes of waking up. \nThis year, I’ve upped my morning game by creating an entire morning routine that doesn’t include my phone. No emails. No social. No texts. No calls. Pings. Mentions. Comments. Surfing. Double taps. Or scrolling. It’s almost a full hour digital detox each morning like this one so that I can make breakfast, meditate and get ready before diving into the digital world. It’s slow, peaceful, and all mine.\nAnd it’s hard. It’s tremendously hard to turn my alarm off while seeing some of the notifications on my homescreen and not want to check everything and just get right into it. I’m tempted to scroll through facebook and twitter while I’m drinking my tea. And I occasionally wonder if there’s anything significant going on that needs my attention. \nThere’s not. There never has been. From taking emails off my phone a few years ago to this new prolonged morning ritual without my phone, not a single problem has arisen that couldn’t be taken care of post routine. And more than that, it changes the entire feeling of my day.\nIf it sounds nice, it’s because it is. And it’s probably the best gift you can give yourself. If your morning routine needs a little overhaul, here’s some places to start:\nAsk Yourself How You Want to Feel\nOne of my soul sisters mentioned this idea to me last week when explaining how to come up with the right ritual for you – ask yourself: “how do I want my morning to feel?” If it’s currently crazed and you want to feel calm, add one thing into your morning that is soft and slow like hot tea on the couch or a stretch sequence by the bed. If you need to pump some strong energy into your day, try a 10 minute workout plan before hopping into the shower. Your morning sets your tone so figure out what you need each day.\nMove Your Phone\nJust do it. Move it away from your bed. I know it’s not the only outlet in your place. Move it so that you’re not scrolling until midnight and facebook before you’re even out of bed in the morning. And when you get to your morning musts, leave it where it is. The best way to combat the temptation of your phone (and it is actually an addiction) is to not have to fight it. If it’s upstairs or in another room while you’re doing your morning thing, you’ll have so much more space to just be, breathe, and prepare. \nStart Small\nI didn’t get to a full hour of a calm morning of soulful preparation for my day off the bat. It started with no emails and has moved to what it is. And some days are a bit speedier than others depending on my schedule. When it comes to your golden morning routine that you can keep up, start small - even just ten minutes - and build onto it.\nNo matter where you begin when it comes to building a morning routine you love, start somewhere. It’ll have such a beautiful impact on your day that you’ll do whatever you can to protect that special time and stick to it.\nFor more tips to feed your soul, follow Maxie’s writing!\nxoxo",
