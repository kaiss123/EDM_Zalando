      "text": "A blog about dressing like a grownup\nJuly 24, 2014\nFragrances, Part Two: How to Choose Something for Yourself\nIn some ways, choosing a fragrance is straightforward: you pick something you’d want to wear. At the same time, there’s more to it than just sniffing the bottle.\nThe first thing you need to know is that fragrances react to your body and evolve over time. So when you’re out shopping for a scent, only use the blotter strips to see what you’d like to sample, and then spray no more than one scent per wrist. That way, your nose won’t be confused. As you wear those scents throughout the day, pay attention to how they change. Scents are described in a musical metaphor as having three sets of notes, which make up a harmonious scent accord. These notes are released over time:\nTop notes: Also known as the head notes, these are what you smell upon immediate application. Top notes are very strong and assertive, and often a bit citrusy. I find them to be too strong when I’m in public, so I apply scents about five minutes before going outside. A scent’s top notes will have evaporated by then. \nMiddle notes: Next are the middle notes, which typically last for about thirty minutes. Middle notes form the heart of a fragrance, and are usually much more well-rounded and mellow. \nBasenotes: A fragrance’s middle notes and basenotes form the real “theme” of a fragrance, which is why you need to give it time before you judge it. Basenotes start to come out after the first thirty minutes and will last until the scent disappears. \nIn addition to paying attention to how something evolves, think about what you’re smelling and whether those scents are suitable for your needs. Things that smell very citrusy, floral, green, or aquatic, for example, might only be good for daytime use, or for the spring and summer seasons. Conversely, things that smell more like wood, amber, vanilla, or leather might be better for nighttime use, or for the fall and winter seasons. Whether something is right for you is as much about when you plan to wear it as it is about your personality.  \nOnce you’ve picked something, the rest is easy.\nStoring: Fragrances are sensitive to light and heat, so store things in cool and dry places, and away from direct sunlight. On top your dresser is fine; on the dashboard of your car is not.\nApplication: Generally speaking, you want to spray fragrances about 3-6 inches away from your body, and directly on pulse points (so neck, inner elbow, or wrist). Remember, fragrances need to react to your body, so don’t apply scents to your clothes. I personally spray stuff on my wrist, and then lightly dab my wrists on my neck. (Rubbing is bad for the oils). Whatever you do, don’t spray fragrances into the air and walk through the mist. That does little more than freshen up the room.  \nAmount: How much you apply is personal, and will depend on the strength of what you’re spraying. Some things require a bit more application; some things less. Obviously: when in doubt, always err on the side of caution. If you want something to last long, just get a longer lasting scent, rather than go wild with a weak one. \nFinally, if you want to try out a new scent, or just develop your nose, buy samplers before you buy bottles. Doing so can be a nice way to check things out without dropping too much money. The Perfumed Court is a popular online source, and you can do a Google search for “fragrance decants.“ You can also find good reviews at Basenotes , where there’s a large online community of enthusiasts.\n",

Though he still kept up with new music—Hughes had been a legendarily voracious record buyer in the old days, admired by rock snobs for the acuity of his soundtrack picks—he now viewed it as his primary duty to be, in his younger son’s words, “the curious, engaged grandpa in the seersucker.””\n",

Though he still kept up with new music—Hughes had been a legendarily voracious record buyer in the old days, admired by rock snobs for the acuity of his soundtrack picks—he now viewed it as his primary duty to be, in his younger son’s words, “the curious, engaged grandpa in the seersucker.””— Vanity Fair’s David Kamp on John Hughes (thanks Rich)",

Seeing these screen shots of me on a huge billboard in Times Square. I’m literally speechless and don’t think I can even explain how I feel. Most importantly I’m beyond thankful to all of you for your support. My blog is so important to me and I work extremely hard on it. I’ve never felt proud, or thought that it was anything special. It’s just me laying on my bed, writing about what I love- fashion. People will say to me “Your blog is doing so well,” and I’m always like “No, no it’s nothing really.” But for some reason when I saw these pictures, for the first time in my life I felt like what I’m doing is important, and people actually care and are listening. It’s not about me, it’s about the blogging world in general and all my fashion blogger friends who are working so hard and accomplishing amazing things that a few years ago no one would have thought was possible. I’m not a model or an actress… just a normal, small town girl who’s passionate about something she loves. It’s a dream come true to be able to share that with people around the world and I hope I can inspire others that anything is possible.\nUnfortunately I won’t be in NY at all this month to see it myself so if anyone happens to be there and could send me a video of it I would be so grateful :)\nOf course huge thank you to Forever 21 and Alex & Chloe who made this all happen!\nXOXO Lots of love to you all.\n",

      "text": "June 17, 2015 Michelle Phan\nThe price we’re willing to pay for beauty can vary a great deal. You can be wiling to pay an arm and a leg for practical beauty tools or stand firm that drugstore brands get the job done. With so many options it isn’t hard to see why people test out the most buzzed about products no matter the price tag. When it comes to buying there are a few rules I follow, but in general if it has solid reviews, contains quality ingredients and applies well, I’m in.\nI’ve tried hundreds of products–many that have blown my mind–but today I wanted to feature 5 of those that no matter what, they’re worth the splurge.\n1. Rm DNA Renewal DNA Sheer Defense – Wearing SPF on your face should be a no brainer at this point, but it’s rare that we think about that protection as a way to help collagen growth as well. DNA Renewal is part of a circle of products emerging that not only act as a light BB Cream with 50+ SPF, but also works to repair existing sun damage with enzymes and vitamins. You could save your money and stick with a 30 SPF face lotion or you can go big to fight cellular damage, even out your skins tone and texture, and be confident that you’ll have all-day coverage without a high shine, oily finish.\n2. La Mer The Lip Balm - La Mer as a brand is no joke. I’ve been using their Creme de la Mer for ages, so it’s not surprising that their a celeb and overall cult fave despite the jaw dropping fee. The Lip Balm is no different. Containing the brand’s mystery Miracle Broth the balm goes on sheer while moisturizing and restoring your lips texture. Since the skin on our lips is one of the most sensitive, and easily affected by the elements, it’s important to take great care of them. If you’ve ever used a balm that had your lips thirsting for another application, you know that you can become dependent on a product. With La Mer that won’t happen, but you’ll want to apply it when necessary for a silky smooth, mega hydrated pout. And if you can’t justify using it for only your lips, luckily there are plenty of other uses for lip balm .\n3. MAC Cosmetics Penultimate Eye Liner - There are a lot of formulas to use and ways to apply your eyeliner . One that always seems like an easy solution, even for the makeup novice, is a liquid marker-like liner. However most, especially those with more affordable price tags, rarely deliver the color results desired and tend to go on more watery and require more effort than your pencil, cream or typical liquid liner. But when you find the right one, these pen style liners offer precision application and major color payoff. That’s why the MAC Penultimate Liner is a must. Along with the Stila Stay All Day Waterproof Liquid Liner , these liners dress up your eyes and go on flawlessly.\n4. NCLA Nail Lacquers – It can be hard to justify paying $16 for nail polish, especially when we change our polish as quickly as our minds. But between all the brands on the market and color options available, sometimes there seems to be a lack of new, original hues to polish on. That’s where NCLA kills it and is worth every penny. While there are crazy neon colors (which aren’t true neons btw) from cheaper brands, there just isn’t that same confetti meets summer vibe meets “Oh You Say You Have Nail Wraps too!” like NCLA offers. Their creamy lacquers are made right here in California and are 5-free . And their holographic line…need I say more! \n5. AmorePacific Color Control Cushion Compact – Cushion compacts were one of the most buzzed about beauty products last year and for good reason. Just like MAC’s eye liner, you have a lot of options when it comes to foundation application, but what makes the AmorePacific Cushion Compact worth the $60 splurge is that it’s basically 3 beauty products rolled into one. The coverage is unbelievable, the cushion applicator allows you to build your product up for light to heavy coverage days, the cushion also provides a streak-free finish (no brushes required) and it touts SPF 50. What better way to protect your face and get an even complexion?\nIs there a beauty product you’re willing to pay a pretty penny for? Let me know below!\n<3 Mish\n",

      "text": "Leave a comment\nFancy Friday with wooden touches\n I’ve kinda gotten stuck in a blue and grey wardrobe rut. Sometimes throwing in some black for a darker colour.\nNow, there’s nothing wrong with that, in fact blue and grey are a fine combination and personally I could (and pretty much do) have my wardrobe consisting of only those colours. Yes! Grey is a colour.\nToday however, I decided I would shift it all up a little, so much so that I did a Fancy Friday on a Monday morning which I usually reserve for being ‘casual’. I wanted it to be colourful and just a little loud, so of course I started with purple pants. You kinda have to really. Once you go bold though, you cant turn back, and the trick becomes adding piece after piece of pattern, texture and brightness to make sure that it all works together despite the fact that it shouldn’t.\nIn this case, I kinda decided that I was going to build the outfit around my shoes, rather than the pants. I cant seem to stop wearing these double monks – they go with everything – despite being a reddish oxblood colour. So in this case, the red / brown detailing in the tie, picked up on the shoes, and the red lapel flower, brought out the red in the tie more, which made it work better with the shoes.

Sometimes throwing in some black for a darker colour.\nNow, there’s nothing wrong with that, in fact blue and grey are a fine combination and personally I could (and pretty much do) have my wardrobe consisting of only those colours. Yes! Grey is a colour.\nToday however, I decided I would shift it all up a little, so much so that I did a Fancy Friday on a Monday morning which I usually reserve for being ‘casual’. I wanted it to be colourful and just a little loud, so of course I started with purple pants. You kinda have to really. Once you go bold though, you cant turn back, and the trick becomes adding piece after piece of pattern, texture and brightness to make sure that it all works together despite the fact that it shouldn’t.\nIn this case, I kinda decided that I was going to build the outfit around my shoes, rather than the pants. I cant seem to stop wearing these double monks – they go with everything – despite being a reddish oxblood colour. So in this case, the red / brown detailing in the tie, picked up on the shoes, and the red lapel flower, brought out the red in the tie more, which made it work better with the shoes. I also wanted to funk up my accessories a bit, while remaining in the same colour palette.\nEnter wood! Yep! Wood!

You see, James Brudnell wore it because he could slip it on and off without disarranging his hair and after that whole disastrous cavalry ride made him the talk of the town, the cardigan was adopted as a fashion craze in high society.\nIt was only after the Second World War that cardigans left the world of formal attire and became symbolic of relaxation. From here on they were adopted by golfers and singers alike, everyone from Arnold Palmer to Bing Crosby and even singers who like to golf like ol’ blue eyes, Mr Frank Sinatra, who was said to have dropped $30 000 a year on knitwear at his local club house.\nIt wasn’t until Kurt Cobain wore his cardigan in the 1990’s as part of his grunge look that the garment lost its grandpa stigma and became a piece of the modern mans wardrobe. For me, the cardigan still carries I like a little bit of both worlds, the ‘dapper granmps’ and the ‘urban trendsetter’ which makes it super versatile.\nSo, why do I consider it an essential, well, I just said, it’s super versatile, it works as well casually with some jeans and a t-shirt as it does layered under a sports coat with a tie, or even worn as a jacket on its own.\nI reccomend getting a couple in different textures and weights, each of them will offer a different wardrobe solution.\nThe one above is my current favourite, Its nice and chunky and really nails the grandpa look with that roll (or shawl) collar.

Although the jacket it cute, the button holes are unraveling and the button are cheap (one of them broke).  I was thinking maybe because I bought this second hand, but no.  The clothes just feel a little cheap in general.  The piece that I won was cute.  I really do like their design aesthetic.  I just had similar issues with the dress that I won.  Button holes unraveling, cheap buttons, and the fabric...well lets just say if you throw it in the washing machine its over for that garment.   Over all, for Shabby Apple, cute clothes, but cheaply made.  I haven't actually bought a piece, but if I were I would be okay paying $89 for a piece, but I definitely would not pay $160.  They seem to clearance some pieces for around $50 and honestly thats what I feel the clothes are worth...around $50.  \nI am really loving the attention that houndstooth is getting this season and I hope to add a few more pieces.  Here are some of my other picks of fun ways to incorporate this print into your wardrobe.\n",

Seriously, it takes less than ten minutes to do my make-up in the morning and it’s mostly fool-proof. However, it seems that when I originally purchased the first kit of colors, I was very tan and chose the medium skin tone. It also seems that over the past three years, tanning has been less appealing to me (maybe because our pool is underground and sucks or maybe because my dad died of skin cancer – could be either?) – anyway, let’s just say I’m not so tan any more – but somehow I still thought I was. I would try to add make-up to my neck to blend it but it never EVER really blended right.\nLast week I went to Sephora and decided to try the lighter shade (fairly light instead of just light). I recall trying this color before and it being too pink for me…or at least I thought.\nIt is not until now, face and neck the same (or really close to the same) color that I realize that I have been walking around with orange face for at least two years. I’m not going to lie, someone mentioned to Pep that I shouldn’t wear so much make-up and he informed me of my mistake too. But he just said TOO MUCH MAKE-UP- not THE WRONG COLOR. So it didn’t click for me. I’m going to TRY to pretend that I actually WAS as tan as I thought I was for a while at least, so as not to crawl up into a whole of embarrassment admitting it was THREE YEARS.\nEither way, the first step is realizing the problem. I can say that I’m not in denial any more and no longer have a case of the orange face!\n",

I wash them in cold and sometime toss them in the dryer or line dry them. I say “them” because I’ve done it to 3 now. All with awesome results.

Awesome. \nA word {or paragraph} about yesterdays post : I promised myself I would never apologize for my blog because well, it’s mine and if you aren’t interested then don’t come here BUT I do want to express a little sorry for my sad post yesterday. Sometimes it just hits like a ton of bricks and yes, I am lucky in so many ways and yes things could be worse and no I’d rather not blather on and on {for years} about how I can’t get pregnant but I do so again and again, thank you for listening. I’ve also noticed when I’m in that little baby funk that my DIYs seem to disappear. Funny thing, sadness, zapping me of my creativity & motivation. Bah I say! But I’ve got a few ideas that I’ll get to work on and share with you very soon 😉 I’ve also been putting off a hair video for about a month now. Such a procrastinator 😉 \nHappy Hump Day …let’s make that literal today, shall we? {well, not YOU and ME literally …but you know what I mean}\n",

      "text": "November 4, 2011 Michelle Phan\nThis Sunday marks the end of Daylight Savings Time, which means most of us will be given an extra hour this weekend to do whatever we want! Growing up, this extra hour was never wasted; most of the time, it was spent helping out with family chores or cleaning up and organizing around the house. While I can’t force you to do these things on Sunday (I’m not your parent, I can’t make you), I would encourage you to make the most out of this hour and have an extra productive day! Do something that you would normally put off, or something that isn’t really a priority but would be nice to get to at some point.\nIf you’re anything like me, bathroom organization is something that definitely falls into this category. My bathroom could always use a little cleaning up – not in the sense that it’s dirty, but in the sense that it tends to get a little cluttered…products tend to accumulate, cabinets fill up, and blow dryers get tossed aside in a hurry out the door. And don’t even get me started on the mountains of makeup : /\nSo, my challenge for you is this: Make the place where you get beautiful more beautiful, and do a little bathroom organization this weekend.\nIt can be hard to know where to start with organization projects, but here are some easy things you can do to clean out your bathroom and maximize your space.\n1. Get rid of your old makeup. Here are some guidelines for knowing when it’s time to toss it.\n2. The backs of cabinet doors are organization gold: hang things, store tools, add jars or hooks, adhere a magnetic strip to keep pins in one place…the opportunities are endless!\n3. Don’t just dump your things on the counter! Well, at least make them look good: head to a craft store or discount home store and pick up some cute jars to toss your things in. Either mix and match, or go for a more classic look with glass or metal jars. You can also use pretty bowls and plates to hold any jewelry you wear on the reg. It will look tidier and more thoughtful!\n4. Nail polish storage can actually be very pretty too. Keep your polishes in a giant clear glass jar – no more hiding them in a basket under the sink!\n5. Clean. Your. Brushes. You have the time! ( Click here for my ultimate brush cleaner.)\n6. Organize your go-to makeup. Acrylic trays are great compartmentalizers. You can either buy something like this from IKEA that’s specifically for cosmetics, or get inexpensive desk organizers from any organization or super store. This is a great way to store your everyday makeup but also keep it readily accessible.\nThere are so many ways you can clean up and prettify a bathroom, but those are just a few. Getting ready in a neat and tidy area will make you feel so much more zen, especially if you have to share a bathroom!\nLet me know if you try any of these methods out! And please share your own helpful organization tricks in the comments section below…I just might feature them in a future blog!\n",

I think Penang might now be one of my favorite travel destinations. White sandy beaches and lots of great food down Gurney Drive. Australians and Brits definitely agree, they are all over the place here having a good time, but only now are Americans just beginning to come. Everyone was telling me to try the famous Asam Laksa in Penang and I have to say, it is SO yummy! I can really take spicy foods, but not as much as I used to. Growing up, I put chili on just about everything haha! I also really like the soy bean milk they serve there a lot! Plus, we had an awesome taxi driver, Ali, who would fetch us here, there, and everywhere, all whiling giving us lots of good information as well as making us laugh just about every five seconds!!But we’ve definitely had other few crazy taxi drivers which nearly scared the crap outta me. But but all in all, I had a safe and wonderful time in Penang. And like I said, very easy dressing. High waisted denim shorts and tanks are my new best friend. After Penang, I spent the last 2 days in Thailand! Took so many beautiful photos. Can’t wait to take a look at them later! But now, I am back in KL for a bit! :)))\n \n",

In fact, many things the past two seasons have caught my eye as being reminiscent of the entomological.\nThe closing dress at Nina Ricci was ethereal and evoked many different emotional responses.

The model’s bare shoulders  and the volumuminous sleeves remind one of the actual process of metamorphosis-the pretty butterfly (aka Tanya) coming out of it’s shell.\nThe frothy fur at Chloe made me think of nothing other than the downy wings of a luna moth, complete with it’s spots and tufts of hair. I spotted similarly wing-like patterning at Prada-don’t the marbled designs of the tunic and the transparency remind you of butterflies? Very dreamy. I also loved the strange cutouts on Marios Scwab’s wobble dress this season.

The saddle bag may be a classic boho shape but in colorful, miniaturized proportions, there’s nothing tired or overdone about it. From exotic embossing in sun-kissed yellow or green, the hip-slung Abby is cool as can be. The Abby can hold all your essentials and more, thanks to the deep gusset. Best of both worlds - you get the cuteness of the small shape with the function of major storage.\nShoulder strap is adjustable. Interior zipper pocket. Slide pocket in back will fit up to an iPhone 6 (but not the plus).\nMeasurements:\nApprox. 7\"L x 3\"W x 7-1/2\"H with an adjustable 23\"L crossbody strap\nShell:\n",

      "text": "Jamie O – At home Microdermabrasion\nBy Tina Craig on April 2, 2007 12:00 pm Tina Craig\nI received a sample of the Jamie O at home microdermabrasion kit from Jamie O herself last month.  We have a mutual friend who loves the product and wanted me to try it.  I was hesitant at first because I didn’t know if I’d like it and well, you all know how brutal I am when I don’t like something but my friend was so certain I’d love it that she told me to be honest and review it as I would any other product.  She put me in touch with Jamie and within 48 hours a package arrived at my door, the box was the prettiest skincare package I’d ever seen!  Pink with grey trim wrapped in a gorgeous grey ribbon, it was so pretty I didn’t want to open it or mess it up.  I finally opened it tonight and tried the microdermabrasion scrub and let me just say, “WOW”.\nEvery winter I get regular microdermabrasion facials (from Katrina at Cooper Spa!) but it leaves my skin too vulnerable in the summer so I depend on over the counter scrubs to exfoliate during the hot months.  I usually use the Fresh Sugar face polish and La Prairie essential exfoliator but will be adding this to my repertoire.  How is Jamie O different from my other scrubs you ask?  First of all, the crystals are so fine it felt like the soft sands of the Maldives.  And it smelled like a dreamcicle (from the vitamin C).  The best part is the lactic acid to put on top of the scrub called the “activator”, my face got really hot for about 5 seconds, very science project-ish and kinda scary at first but it went away very quickly.  After rinsing it off, my skin was smooth like porcelain.  It’s very close to the same smoothness achieved with a professional microdermabrasion machine but at a fraction of the cost.  At $69, it is less than half the price of a one time microdermabrasion session and will last you all summer. At JamieO skincare.\nYou Will Also Like\n",

      "text": "ABBA Pure Detox Shampoo: Send Your Hair to Rehab\nBy Kelly Cook on April 28, 2011 12:00 pm Kelly Cook\nBe prepared: I’m pretty excited about this! I experienced crazy amazing, plentiful results from ABBA‘s Pure Detox Shampoo. You know how your body needs a good detoxing sometimes? Well, our hair is the same. The build-up from products, chlorine, pollution, and simple hair grease take their toll – and every so often our hair needs a chance to get back to its natural state. Well, only a good total cleansing can achieve that. Sure, the delicate shampoos are great to prevent stripping and drying, but once in awhile you need more.\nSo how about a shampoo that is gentle, but cleans your hair so thoroughly that it is actually softer, more manageable, and more voluminous? So much so that you don’t’ even recognize it as your own hair?! I bought this shampoo in preparation for the impending summer of swimming in pools, thinking it would be the perfect product to purify my hair of chlorine.\nI decided to test it out ahead of time and was blown away. My hair took on a whole new characteristic. I had thought my hair felt heavy because of its thickness – and that was why it seemed so “unstylable.” But I was wrong – it was all because of toxic build-up. After one shampooing my hair was as smooth and shiny as if I’d just gotten a blow-out. It felt completely different – soft and feathery – something I never thought my hair could ever be. Made with molasses and baking soda, the consistency and color is just like molasses. It wafts a hint of a Chinese herbal scent, which I personally love, but it might take others some getting used to. I followed up with Pure Basic Trumint Conditioner\n, which hydrated my hair and scalp. Its scent of rosemary and mint is really nice. I recommend using both – but if anything, the shampoo is a must try!  On Amazon for $14.60.\nYou Will Also Like\n",

Louis Vuitton has come up with the most festive bag of the most carefree season.  Inspired by the sun-soaked foliage of the Mediterranean, their Summer 2013 collection is a celebration of blue skies, beaming rays, and unabashed optimism.\nThe freshest interpretation of the collection comes by way of the newest Monogram Vernis tote. A peppy vision has doused their quintessential leather with a gorgeous explosion of abstract print and vivid color. While all the classic Louis Vuitton elements are there – the nude straps, stitched to perfection, and of course, their trademark allover monogram – these painterly blossoms breathe new life into an old faithful. It comes in two styles: the north-south Catalina NS and the east-west Catalina BB, and your choice of two colors, Grand Bleu and Rose Indien. Let Louis be the first to remind you this summer: life’s too short to not take time and smell the roses…or carry a tote that lifts your mood.\nCatalina BB, $1,700, and Catalina NS, $2,730, at Louis Vuitton .\nYou Will Also Like\n",

Things such as a slightly lopsided vase, a shirt that’s missing a button, or an old, wooden desk that’s a little too dry. It’s believed that by recognizing the beauty in such things, we can better appreciate the natural cycle of life – from growth to decay to eventually death. \nJonathan Lukacek – the very talented blogger behind Bandanna Almanac – is certainly familiar with the concept. He’s an American living in Japan, having stayed there after studying abroad for college. He’s also an inveterate thrifter who likes to collect garments with a lot character (rather than things that happen to be rare or hold value). In other words, “things that tell a story,” as he put it to me. \nSeen above are some of the creative ways he’s repaired his vintage finds. There’s a pair of jeans with pocket bags made from cut-up bandannas; a dirty collar of a denim shirt made new again through some more bandanna cloth; an old Five Brothers flannel with a slightly askew internal pocket (made with just the right amount of pattern matching); a denim jacket with blanket lining on the outside of the coat; and finally, some decorative sashiko stitching on the collar of an old chambray shirt. \nEverything was done with fabrics that Jonathan has either thrifted or found over the years. Some repairs he did himself; others he did in collaboration with his good friend Narita at Brown Tabby (a vintage repair shop in Japan). All of it is awesome – especially if you’ve ever appreciated anything at a thrift store or flea market, or even the designer lines that are inspired by such things (e.g. Blue Blue Japan , Kapital , and Visvim ). \nYou can see more of Jonathan’s work at his Instagram account.

Now, if you’re about to enter the new age bracket (the 35-45 box at the doctor’s office) or above, you need to know about this!  I was sent a sample of Sensai’s Eye Wrinkle cream a month ago and despite the PR person warning me it was very rich and probably best for a more mature skin, I generously applied it twice a day.  The consistency is really thick but goes on fairly smoothly and I liked how it nourishing it felt around the eyes (and diminished the lines!).  However, I noticed a tiny white bump under my right eye recently which my facialist tells me is probably from over use of the very rich eye cream!  So I’m back to using my iS clinical eye cream (heard they have a new version coming, out can’t wait!) and saving this for days I feel really old and tired.  If you are very dry or have very mature skin– definitely try this.  Go ask for a sample at the counter at Neiman/Bergdorf and see if it’s too rich for you.  I’m an eye cream addict and slather on eye cream like there’s no tomorrow but now I will use the tiny bit that they always recommend because I don’t want those little white bumps to appear again! \n",

The leather is paper thin with a slight laminate that gives it an actual paper texture.  When you have it on your shoulder the texture of the leather allows for incredible draping that isn’t too scrunched, you get that perfect sculptural scallop.  There is a hidden magnetic closure so when the two sides are closed, the draping is more of a fold.  You get subtle changes in the look depending on how it slouches.  The strap is long enough to hang comfortably at your side and it stays on!  It is also super lightweight.  I can’t decide what I love most – the shape, function or beauty!

      "text": "The Next Savage Beauties\nWhen I put out an opinion poll out on Instagram asking which young designer could, aesthetics aside, leave a lasting legacy like Lee McQueen, the names that came up pleasingly revolved around London: Simone Rocha, Christopher Kane and J.W. Anderson.  They are all brands with sure fire longevity in the making (or in Kane’s case, this already exists).  There were also some curveball answers like Jeremy Scott or Alexander Wang, who are perhaps diametrically opposite to \nMcQueen.  Perhaps people got stuck on the word legacy and thought of the brands that would go the distance.\nTo conclude my collaboration with American Express, which first began with a visit to the McQueen: Savage Beauty exhibition at the V&A, I wanted to put together a list of trailblazing designers that I think draw comparison with McQueen on an aesthetic level, but that also place innovation and experimentation at the heart of what they do, and who might also merit having their work scrutinised by a museum curator twenty years from now, just as McQueen has.  Nowadays, the word ‘groundbreaking’ isn’t often seen in fashion show reviews, unless used as hyperbole.  And yet I believe that McQueen, for all his love of the historical and the traditional, did break new ground, whether it was in the cut of a silhouette or in his mode of showmanship.  Therefore perhaps the question should be different:  Who is currently innovating fashion and pushing it to somewhere that can be called ‘new’?\nThe one name that did get crop up on Instagram unsurprisingly, was Dutch designer  Iris van Herpen .If not for the stylistic and thematic similarities, then for her demi-couture approach that only recently saw her branch off from haute couture to ready to wear.  In my opinion, you can see her work is no less considered, as incredible close-up shots of the fabrics from her latest “Hacking Infinity” A/W 15-6 collection reveal.  Her work simply does not come from the realm of convention, nor is it bound by a sense of reality.  \nFor her latest collection, van Herpen imagined the biosphere of another planet and the textures that might inhabit its terrain.  A stainless steel weave is burnt so that it glimmers with hues of an oil-slick and then pleated and shaped into circular formations.  A 3D hand woven grid-like textile is created in collaboration with Aleksandra Gaca, creating an optical illusion.  In an ongoing bid to constantly look beyond fashion, van Herpen also works with professor of architecture Philip Beesley, to design sculptural dresses made out of fractal-like geometries.  Crystals crafted from 3D printing grow from beneath the vertiginous heels of Noritaka Tatehana.  McQueen had already begun to probe the dystopian questions of how the world might look in the future.  Van Herpen has set herself the path to take that probing further, aided by technologies in fabrications that McQueen may have delved into himself. \nIt might be fair to say Kunihiko Morinaga of Anrealage  has drawn more comparisons with Hussein Chalayan than Alexander McQueen. His shows, which have decamped from Tokyo Fashion Week to Paris for the last two seasons, deserve praise for their willingness to open our jaded eyes to something really new.  Last season for Morinaga’s Paris debut, he played with photo and heat sensitive inks on white garments so that faint patterns would be revealed when shone with laser-like beams of light.   \nThis season, the effect was more dramatic as it was inverted with seemingly black fabrics made to reveal hidden patterns under ultraviolet light.  That effect was pre-empted with blacked-out garments printed with fade-in/fade-out patterns. In the final portion of the show, out trooped models in black ensembles which were embedded with photochromic patterns, that could only be seen when under UV light.  The UV spotlights moving around revealed distinct patterns of polka dots, floral prints and checks that would then disappear into darkness as soon as the UV was switched off.  It’s difficult to assess where all this supreme fabric research and innovation can go in the practical world, but I believe Morinaga is shining a spotlight (literally) on what may be possible in the world of textiles and there’s still so much potential.  Anrealage’s shows are a feast for the brain.  You leave excited about what is next.\n",

You leave excited about what is next.\n\n\nFinally, The Unseen isn’t a fashion label per se, but to me, it embodies the trailblazing spirit of McQueen in what it does.  Founded by self-proclaimed alchemist Lauren Bowker, who studied printed textiles at the Royal College of Art, The Unseen is more like a house of exploration, focusing on the metamorphosis of materials.  Bowker has been creating chromic, colour-chana inks that can then be applied to various disciplines, with fashion being one of them.  Alongside Bowker, The Unseen, now based in the Vaults in Somerset House, consists of anatomists, engineers, chemists and pattern cutters, who collectively aim to put their “magick” into bespoke projects.  \nTheir work is primarily based around inks that are sensitive to wind, heat, moisture and light and they, in turn, have been applied to couture pieces that act as a spectacular showcase in terms of what The Unseen can do.  For example, a winged cape that changes colour upon contact with the air around it, or a skull cap glowing with Swarovski spinel stones that visualise the heat loss from the head, graduating in colour from orange to red to green, to blue to purple.  Its latest piece entitled, “Eight Sense” is a coded couture piece, which changes in response to real-time digital media as it aims to discover and investigate the human state of being, by using a physical garment linked with human magnetism.  \nSo, basically… a wearable mood ring?  You might ask, who really needs that?  But when the effects are so beautiful, it makes you wonder how much more we can explore by bringing chemistry and fashion together.  You’re more than welcome to find out more by visiting The Unseen as they continue their explorative residency at Somerset House.  I’ll be delving deeper into what their “magick” entails soon enough and keeping an eye on all the aforementioned talent to see how they continue to trail blaze in their work; just as Alexander McQueen did before them.",

For this see-it-buy-it-wear-it collection, Stella Tennant flanked by rugged redhead lads in Scottish tartan from a 1995 campaign made its presence be known with asymmetric kilts (for guys and girls), plaid sweaters and perfectly proportioned shirts that can be semi-tucked in and out.  The black dresses of Vaccarello’s first outing for Versus also reappear with askant hemlines and Versace lion’s head continues to rear its head in the silver hardware.  The “happening” may have been in London but the appeal of Vaccarello’s Versus revival certainly goes far and beyond the big smoke.",

      "text": "My desk is my home inside my home. I spend a lot of my time sitting at my desk writing mostly, and I have to be 100% comfortable. It's actually the smallest nook that actually has some sort of use. I kind of love that little nook. It's safe and cozy and I get my best work done there.\n\nNow... as much as I love my own desk, I'm actually fascinated with other people's. But, to be frank, I'm not interested in overly stylized, non-functional desks that you see in catalogs and magazines (and, well, Pinterest). I want to see where people actually work.\n\nI asked four of my friends (Inslee, Alison, Katie, and Fred) in completely different industries to share their desks. I think there's something really personal about each desk, and for that, I'm so thankful they were open enough to give us all a peek!\n\n\n\n\nInslee Haynes' Tips for Staying Organized\n1. Plan a time to answer email and stick to it. Don't let email control your day by replying every time something comes in our you'll be tied to your inbox until midnight without doing any real work.\n2. Clean up at the end of every day so you can start each new day with a clear head and a clear workspace.\n3. Know when to quit. Trying to cram too many things into one day is the fastest way I get disorganized so I always plan a time to stop each day and try to stick to it (baring an illustration emergency, believe it or not, they exist).\n\nWhy it's my favorite motivational quote: There are a few things that I repeatedly tell myself to calm down and stay focused. My favorite of which is \"this too shall pass\" which I learned in a yoga class at a moment when half the class was giving up and collapsing onto their mats. The teacher shouted that out to us and it totally saved me. I say this to myself all the time and it sets everything in perspective... Dealing with a tough client - this too shall pass.... Feeling like I can't get my whole to do list accomplished - this too shall pass... Getting an amazing new client or opportunity - savor this moment carefully because, yep, this too shall pass!\n\n(Inslee.net)\n\n\n\n\nAlison's Tips for Staying Organized\n\n1. Though I also have a MacBook Pro, I do much of my design and planning on this desktop. I love to listen to music while I work, but my only requirement is that I know the lyrics. (If I don't, I will be paying more attention to learning those than on my work!) Gus and Mr. Pinky, our cats, are my steadfast office companions!\n2.

      "text": "One Tuesday afternoon, I bought a Chanel bag .\nI had to do it. I have always harbored a poorly concealed crush on the 2.55’s boxy frame and softly glazed lambskin. Even when the chain-linked miracle prostituted itself on the arm of Snooki, my love for its classic appeal never wavered. I know that it’s been deemed suburban and ubiquitous and that all of the Real Housewives carry it, but there is something about its enduring charm that reminds me of my grandmother and pearls and Alexa Chung. So when I spotted it online and on sale—which happens once every never—and discounted by a healthy 30%, I did not hesitate. Now was not the time to ask myself such questions as, “Can you put a down payment on a bag?” or “Do people really sell their kidneys on the black market?” I had only one option: “Add to Cart.”\nI owned it for exactly thirty minutes.\nA brief interlude for sanity: I’m twenty years old and in college. I may not have the best handle on fiscal responsibility, but I’m not financially suicidal. Also, I’d prefer that my parents not disown me for retail dalliances that result in the purchase of inky-black leather goods. I could not buy the bag. But I could pretend. For the brief window it would sit in my shopping cart, it would be mine.\nI wish I could say this is the first time I’ve succumbed to such behavior. Years ago, on the last day of a trip to London, I ambled into the Burberry flagship and tried on a trench coat. I slipped each arm through its meticulously pressed sleeves while the store manager bustled about and illustrated her expert tailoring suggestions with a smattering of pins. I was not in the market for this class of investment. But I let the woman in plaid go on, and when she was finished ministering to the garment, I appraised my reflection and asked her if I could put in on hold.\n“Until the end of the day,” she said. “That would be wonderful,” I replied effortlessly. “Thank you so much.” By the time the store closed that day, I was halfway over the Atlantic.\nI am in love with the idea of sequestering things I know I cannot have. It’s an indulgent practice. It’s childish. But fast-forward half a decade and save for a blissful half hour I once spent with my best friend eating raw cookie dough straight from the supermarket package, those 1,800 seconds of fabricated Chanel proprietorship were some of the most exhilarating of my life.\nThey were also the most agonizing. No sooner had I staked my claim in the storied House of Chanel than the cool, mathematical robots behind Shopbop.com’s glossy façade saw to its excruciating undoing. But I found my silver lining. Now was my chance, I reasoned. Why stop at Chanel when I could also fictitiously load up on Wang and Stella McCartney ? When I could buy white satin loafers? Why settle for a $2,240 price tag when I could let my subtotal wander into quintuple digits with no repercussions? Who would care if I did? You don’t pay shipping fees on delusions.\nAs I bid a prolonged adieu to something I’d never had, my forever-unrealized future with the original cross-body flashed before my eyes. I imagined slipping it over my shoulder on the cusp of promising Saturday nights only to rescue it later from sticky tables and slimy boys. I envisioned wearing it with sequins and satin and seersucker. Years would go by, and its changing contents would reflect…what? Maturity? One day I would pass it on—its insides defaced with errant pen markings and lipstick stains—to a featureless daughter of mine. We’d had a good run, I’d think lovingly, as I bequeathed it to her. We’d been perfect together!\nBut, of course, we hadn’t been. We were separating before our first date. We loved each other, but we were irreconcilable. We were Courtney Cox and David Arquette, and although I rooted for us, I knew all along that our differences were insurmountable.\nPredictably, one of us would rebound (ed note: ricochet) faster than the other. About seven seconds after my thirty-minute grace period had elapsed, I\nRip the Band-Aid!\nrefreshed the web page and braced myself. The bag, Shopbop.com informed me, was already sold out.\nTo the woman who swooped in and snatched my shot at happiness: Please be kind. Respect it. Treasure it for more than thirty minutes.

Die Tage werden kürzer, es wird schneller dunkel und kälter, somit verbringt man mehr Zeit drinnen. Ich trotze dem kalten und nassen Wetter dann meistens mit einer Serie und einer Tasse Tee, dazu meine Lieblingsschoko (Apple Crumble von Lindt! Yummy.) und ich bin glücklich. Außerdem kann ich endlich wieder meine geliebten Duftkerzen anzünden!\nWie schon so oft erwähnt, gehören für mich kuschelige Pullis einfach zum Herbst. Oben seht ihr ein paar meiner liebsten, von Mango, Ralph Lauren und Zara. Schal, Mütze und Handschuhe sind morgens ein Muss für mich. Den karierten Schal von Zara kennt ihr vielleicht schon aus dem letzten Outfit , der schwarz-weiße Schal (nicht aktuell), die Handschuhe (aus dem letzten Jahr) und die Mütze (aktuell) sind von H&M.\nVor kurzem hab ich die Marke Kringle Candle Company für mich entdeckt. Schon im April bin ich durch Wien-Mitte darauf aufmerksam geworden, hab dann wieder darauf vergessen, bis die liebe Julia vor kurzem ein Bild dazu auf Instagram gepostet hat. Sie sind den Kerzen von Yankee Candle sehr ähnlich, kein Wunder denn die Idee dazu kam vom Sohn des Erfinders der Yankee Candle Company. Das schlichte Design der Kringle Kerzen gefällt mir aber um einiges besser. Ich hab im Österreichischen Online Shop gleich eine große Bestellung aufgegeben, aber davon sind einige Kerzen schon als Weihnachtsgeschenke gedacht.\nHerbst und Tee gehören für mich zusammen. Ich versuche jeden Tag mindestens zwei Liter davon zu trinken. Damit es nicht langweilig wird, hab ich einen riesen Vorrat zu Hause angesammelt. Meine liebsten Sorten sind momentan Ingwer & Zitrone von Teekanne und Kusmi Tea und die Sachermischung von Haas & Haas. Wenn ihr in Wien seid, solltet ihr unbedingt im Shop von Haas & Haas am Stephansplatz vorbei schauen, es gibt eine große Auswahl und ich könnte dort stundenlang stöbern.\nMeine Lieblingsserie momentan ist Devious Maids, sie erinnert ein bisschen an Desperate Housewives!\nWas gehört für euch im Herbst einfach dazu?\nKommentare:\n",

It's funny, when you visit a place fairly regularly - you get into a routine. You stay at the same hotels, eat at the same places. Often, I can spend my entire 2-3 days in a square mile radius!\nThis trip, I knew I wanted a different experience. I'd venture out and stay at a hotel I've never been to and go for more of that home away from home feeling. I'd heard great things about Pali House - there's one in West Hollywood (where I stayed) and one in Santa Monica - so I figured I'd give it a try. I love boutique hotels with a bit of whimsey. The first photo is the view walking into the door. I was greeted by a very friendly front desk clerk who took my luggage down the stairs. Check it was easy and the elevator to the rooms are through this charming courtyard restaurant.\nI stayed in the Studio Residence which is basically a studio loft apartment that most New Yorkers would kill for. It's spacious, open and has a full kitchen. I didn't do any cooking in the three days I was here but the full size fridge was fab to have since I had guests over one day. The large marble bathroom is gorgeous - a little dark so no photos sorry!\nYou can check out the open floor plan here. Quite a large room and the sectional sofa can double as a spare bed. The glass door leads to patio, featured below. All in all a terrific hotel I would definitely stay again. Just don't take outfit photos in the courtyard outside your room - \"photo-shoots\" are apparently, a thing...\nBoyfriend Nightshirt *that I totally wore as clothes c/o Simply Be, Kari Patent Sandals c/o Long Tall Sally\nPhotos of me, Jessica Castro\nCurrently Coveting\n",

      "text": "Prada Metallic Braided Strappy Sandal: Snob Summer Shoes\nBy Tina Craig on May 1, 2011 10:20 am Tina Craig\nI’ve been a very well-behaved shoe snob this year, just narrowing it down to a few pairs I absolutely love and know I’ll wear often throughout the season, instead of pouncing on every pretty shoe I see. It takes a lot of restraint, trust me. It also requires planning. After weeks of debate and counsel with our in-house shoe snob counsel, Sasha Charnin Morrison, I narrowed my choices down to Valentino’s eclectic studded wedges in brown and Prada’s sickeningly amazing gold-braided platforms. One casual, with mixed materials to keep things interesting, and one fancy, since I realized it was time to give my feet the Midas touch. What else does a girl need for a summer in Europe and Asia?!\nI’m on the plane right now (love blogging from 30,000 feet up in the air!) and the minute I land I will head to Bergdorf Goodman to pick up my shoes from Eddie, my trusted SA in Bergdorf’s fabulous shoe department.\nPrada Metallic Braided Strappy Sandal At Bergdorf Goodman for $990.\nValentino Studded T-Strap Espadrille At Bergdorf Goodman for $695.\nPhoto of my shoes courtesy of Eddie at Bergdorfs!

      "text": "Who Needs Josie Maran Argan Matchmaker Serum The Most?\nBy Sharon Feiereisen on March 8, 2011 6:00 am Sharon Feiereisen\nThe other week I went to a Sephora event to check-out their March/April Hot Now products and was immediately blown away by Josie Maran’s Argan Matchmaker Serum Foundation\n($42). It’s a sci-fi-like foundation that looks white when you apply it on your skin and then a second later it adapts to your color to blend in seamlessly. It comes in a light and dark shade and I was standing next to a woman of color who took the dark shade, while I tried the light one and it actually worked for both of us! Seriously very cool to play with. Its got a light consistency, which I’m guessing is because of the Argan oil in its formulation, so the plus is that aside from not needing to sort through a bunch of shades to find the right one for you, the Matchmaker works double duty to moisturize skin. I personally prefer a thicker formulation however, so while I don’t think I will be giving up my Sensai Liquid Finish Foundation anytime soon (their Natural Beige saved me from years of less than perfect foundation for my skin tone!), there are a bunch of celebrities that could seriously use some help when it comes to matching makeup to their skin. Who needs this newbie Josie Maran product the most?? Vote in our poll!\n",

      "text": "Jérôme Dreyfuss Florent Leopard-Print Calf-Hair Backpack: Leader of the Pack\nBy Kelly Cook on February 5, 2014 6:00 am Kelly Cook\nFrom the low to the high , you absolutely must get a backpack if you don’t already have one. But there’s one major rule that comes with the territory: you must steer clear of looking like a schoolgirl (unless, of course, you’re trying to look like a schoolgirl, but that’s a story for a different day).\nEnsure you don’t end up in knee socks and pigtails, and opt for this Jérôme Dreyfuss satchel-esque backpack. With leopard-print pony hair, it’s pure city-chic. Skinny leather straps mixed up with chain details evoke a sense of luxury. Plus, the straps are removable so you can wear it like a satchel, with the handle resting in the crook of your arm. A great hidden back zip allows you to access the interior without going through the flap. With an ultimate emphasis on the awesome print, this is no-brainer cool mixed with easy function. Jérôme Dreyfuss backpack on NET-A-PORTER\nfor $1,140.\nPair with: Go gutsy and playful by wearing this backpack with Miu Miu’s covetably cute cropped peasant top . A music-note print on bubblegum pink silk-twill is a game-changer for your sunny-afternoon repertoire. On My Theresa\nfor $835.\n",

Not that there I'm saying the show should have been devoid of emotion but let's tone down the dramatics and start anticipating what's around the corner – Raf Simons is well and alive and has the ability to take his skill and vision and apply them to any number of houses in addition to continue doing so for his own brand (Raf Simons womenswear – imagine that eh?).  It is an end of sorts but also a new beginning for Simons as well as for Jil Sander, which will see the return of the brand's founder.  Something else to get excited about.   \nThe collection itself was in fact a delicate continuation of what Simons has been exploring for the past three seasons – exploring mid twentieth century couture through a sharply finessed looking glass.  The delicacy of lingerie-inspired palette steered clear from what's going on in the rest of the season and had most of us swooning at how Simons had progressed to a point where he's comfortable with conveying ultra femininity in his work.  It was difficult to get away from the Dior allusions, especially in the use of gravity defying volume, best seen in the coats that the models clutched together at the chest and in the gathers of fabric around the hip in synthesised corset dresses.  If we have been reading it correctly, that Simons has been \"auditioning\" for the creative director role at Dior and if it is to be that Avenue Montaigne will indeed be his next workplace, then we can get REALLY excited about what's around the corner.  Imagine some of these dresses in a Dior show.  \nI'll stop at that wild speculation and say that I also did find myself reminiscing over some of the key moments of Simons' collections for Jil Sander – the S/S 08 sunset colours, the ripped textures of S/S 10, the flat boots and short shift dresses proposed in A/W 10-11 and then the onslaught of stellar collections from S/S 11 to S/S 12.  These collections filtered down to real shifts in the way women dressed and there is no doubt that Simons will continue creating these shifts.  This show wasn't an adieu, but an au revoir, as in we'll be seeing Simons again.    \n",

Not the persona or the singer alas, but the type of cat power that gives me the strength to zip around shows, not feel the increasingly abrasive cold and also answer interview questions about Downton Abbey (I LOVE the fact that Downton has gone Stateside and that I'm suddenly the token British spokesperson to talk about it in fashion interviews).\nIn addition to the cat power, I've pulled another Topshop shocker.  Meaning I wore something from Topshop and people go \"No?  Really?  Topshop?!?\"  This Topshop Boutique skirt and matching bomber jacket are poofy in all the right places and features a nubbly graphic weave in the polyester that makes you think polyester is actually incredible as a fabric.  To top it all off, these Simone Rocha wedges got a proper trial.  Walkability?  A half an hour walk and they start hurting a little but err shamfully, I get to zip around in a Range Rover Evoque for the week, so I get to practise the art of swinging your legs elegantly out of a car without looking like a tangle of limbs.      \n\n\n(Photograph above by Nam for Grazia.it)\n\n(Yes, I'm getting incredibly juvenile with my S-pen that comes with the Samsung Galaxy Note that I've been using…)",

      "text": "Cornered\nIt seems like an odd thing to have flown into Milan and on the first day, post about what is essentially a young designer initiative.  I do still have a flood of NYFW/LFW stuff to go up but all in due course.  First up is a call to action by Vogue Italia and The Corner who have teamed up to present the second edition of a group of eleven designers, all given editorial and prime e-commerce positioning.  Yoox Group's collaboration activites are numerous and for some reason, generally slips by unnoticed, without creating too much of a fanfare.  The Vogue Talents Corner project was feted last night with all eleven designers displaying their S/S 12 pieces, which are currently available to buy on The Corner and then a small preview of their A/W 12-3 collection, ready for me to get stuck into discovering.  Some of the names were new to me and some were familiar and thankfully all formed a potent selection that was splendidly varied.  The Corner is probably one of the big e-commerce power players that does tend to go for a more directional buy in terms of its stock and so adding these eleven designers to the site feels fairly seamless.  As Federico Marchetti, founder and CEO of Yoox Group pointed out, The Corner is there to take risks and for these eleven designers, hopefully the risk pays off. \n……………………………………………………………………………………\nMungo Gurney – Yes, that is the designer's actual name and no, I stupidly didn't ask him where it came from.  I did glean that Mungo is only one collection in and already the S/S 12 collection is in Browns Focus, Luisa Viaroma, No.6 in New York and now The Corner .  His collection is primarily print focused with an emphasis on vibrantly colour blocked swimwear.  His sophomore A/W 12-3 collection is still fairly print focused but the colours are slightly more muted and detailed.  He'll be doing an event to properly present the whole collection back in London after fashion week so I'll hopefully get the chance to ask him what exactly is the deal with his name. \nA/W 12-3\nS/S12:\n……………………………………………………………………………………\nC.B. Made in Italy – Cecilia Bringheli isn't the only brand doing slippers but her's are especially well crafted, made in a small factory in Northern Italy and designed to ensure maximum comfort for the wearer.  She chooses her patterns and prints wisely and a pair adorned with a watercolour floral from the S/S 12 collection are particularly fetching. Tweeds, checks and wools dominate her A/W 12-3 crop of slippers but it's these richly hued suede ankle boots that look mighty appealing. \nA/W 12-3:\nS/S 12:\n……………………………………………………………………………………\nLeitmotif – I became familiar with Fabio Sasso and Juan Caro's work through their menswear collections at Pitti.  I predictably fell for their prints that combined baroque and gothic inspired patterns, lifting and collaging them into imaginary landscapes.  Incidentally, they've become my go to answer whenever people quiz me about up and coming designers based in Italy.  Their S/S 12 collection is a riotous trip that is saved by the fairly simple shapes.   \nA/W 12-3:\nS/S 12:\n……………………………………………………………………………………\nAI_Andrea Incontri – I already wrote about AI's S/S 12 collection of odd uniformity and it's pleasing to see some of those pieces on TheCorner.  What started off as a disciplined accessories label only recently forayed into simple garments.  AI has now shifted into adding one wardrobe cornerstone at a time – first the bag, then the cotton t-shirt and now the coat – which were made in collaboration with Hapsburg, in a project that explored the shade of loden.  Speckled leathers that look like stingray sparkle their way on to little pouches and wristlet bags and then on to shoes, another new addition. \nA/W 12-3: \nS/S 12:\n……………………………………………………………………………………\nHexa by Kuho – I've attended a few of Korean-born designer Kuho Jung's shows in New York and S/S 12 was by far my favourite one with his unusual fixation on Russian military badges.  In what was a fairly minimal and precise collection, a splay of badges came bursting forth and was visually appealing in a weirdly literal sort of way.   \n……………………………………………………………………………………\nVernissage – You might be sick of animalia gracing jewellery but Illenia Corti and Matteo Mena don't look at the obvious species of the animal world to focus on.  They sit somewhere between fine and costume jewellery, applying the principles of handcrafted, non-identikit way of working to their pieces.  Everything has a precious antiqued look to it and yet there's a playfulness to pieces like the firefly ring and earrings which actually have movable wings. \nA/W 12-3:\nS/S 12:\n……………………………………………………………………………………\nBenedetta Bruzziches – The one and only pure bag label in the mix was definitely intriguing.  The chesterfield inspired quilted bags looked at first like a witty take on the Chanel 2.55 but then in other parts of the collection , you have a fox head winking back at you as well as a chalk paper shopping bag complete with a to-buy list written on the side.  It's hard to see what exactly is Bruzziches' bag niche but perhaps she's still finding that out herself.     \nA/W 12-3:\nS/S 12:\n……………………………………………………………………………………\nJoanne Stoker – This ex-architect turned shoe designer twinkled her way into my life when I saw her beautiful, completely NON-gimmicky shoes that have LED lights in the heels.  This Cordwainers graduate impresses in her other designs that mix up unusual resinned inlays with a plainer upper.  This is clever shoe collaging with stunning effects.  I feel a post coming on titled \"Stoked with Stoker\" as I'm sure to revisit her work soon enough. \nA/W 12-3:\nS/S 12:\n……………………………………………………………………………………\nRicostru – Hurrah!  I score my first Guangzhou-based designer by way of Riko Manchit Au, whose label Ricostru (from the Italian word for reconstruction), seeks to readdress refined basics for the women, whilst maintaining a low carbon footprint.  I got to converse in a few words of Cantonese and also find that Ricostru actually already has its own boutique in Shanghai. \nI also got to see the jewellery by Rosalyn Citta Paramitha, a friend of Au's with whom she studied at the Institute of Marangoni.  These sculpted metal shards go hand in hand with the pure lines of the Ricostru pieces. \n……………………………………………………………………………………\nPedro Lourenco – This young Brazilian designer needs little introduction as he bravely burst on to the Paris calendar a few seasons ago and is in fact, currently preparing for his proper A/W 12-3 show.  I think his pre fall collection is probably his most mature yet where glacier prints are spliced into knit dresses and wool coats are subtly dyed to look like frost had bit into the shades of blue and peach.  The tricksy pieces from his S/S 12 collection are perhaps not a true reflection of where Lourenco is at now, design-wise but we shall see in about a week's time. \nPre-fall 2012:\nS/S 12:\n……………………………………………………………………………………\nShourouk – Shourouk's jewellery instantly caught the eye of details maven Tommy Ton, who would probably have a ball shooting some of these pieces .  This Parisian-based jeweller honed her skills at Galliano and Chloe before starting out on her own and progressively becoming more daring with the composition of her bling-heavy pieces.  For A/W 12-3, she has ventured into pinked edged handbags which equally get a heavy dose of paste and sparkle that are prompting the magpie in me to hope that TheCorner will continue to support her work.   \nA/W 12-3\n",

      "text": "Culinary Comforts\nWithin a single Stockholm Fashion Week, I got to talk to not one but TWO designers about food.  DOUBLE SCORE!  First it was Carin Wester's abstracted Parisians bistros and brasseries and then yesterday, I began at Mathias Dahlgren's Matbaren where Rodebjer presented their A/W 12-3 collection and ended the day, with a meal at that very same establishment, eating pig's head and pickled cucumber.  A fitting end to a trip where keeping warm, seeing warmth-inducing collections and good food has gone hand in hand with each other.  There was a reason why Carin Rodebjer chose that venue to show her collection.  She spoke of relating to Dahlgren, drawing parallels between his harmonious food creations and her own attitude towards the sort of women that command her clothes rather than the other way round. \nIt's with this notion in mind that she thought of men's fashion icons such as David Hockney, Jean Cocteau and Prince Michael Duke of Kent for her new collection.  It wasn't that she wanted to inject menswear dress codes into the collection but it's more about the attitude and the ease with which these men inhabit their clothes that she brought to her clothes.  In general, that is the raison d'√™tre of all Rodebjer collections but there was definitely something luxuriously comforting about the recipe that she had cooked up in Dahlgren's premises, all of which instantly looked like go-to-staples – a knee length kimono coat with arm patches, the sweaters and skirts in a texturised faux fur that from a distance looked like crushed velvet, the idea of layering up two polo necks (thanks Carin – I'm shamelessly nicking that idea to keep my neck warm in New York) and a wrapped shirt printed with garden blooms.  Accessories such as the flat leather slip-ons and the A3 sized clutches (suggesting that it might hold something more substantial than a lippie and a phone) were the perfect ingredients to complete this succinctly edited wardrobe.\nI know it sounds like a bit of a la-di-da drone, but editing does seem to be a problem at Stockholm shows.  There's no need to hammer home the point by showing EVERY single style in EVERY possible colour way.  Rodebjer did no such thing.  Actually, I left the show wanting more.  Fortunately, Rodebjer has support from the likes of bStore in London and a very well-stocked webstore of their own .  Hopefully the reality of wearing this collection feels every bit as good as my meal did at Matbaren.  Steve's iPhone pics are my one boshed attempt at throwing in my secondary passion here.

The menswear was perhaps slightly erring on the more casual side when compared with the womenswear but that didn't lessen the direction of the show which was WWII military in spirit to begin with and then darkened into a tangible woodland fantasy where burgandy velvet devor√© with leaf motifs, a rainbow cornucopia of fabric flowers and cut silk and knots of silk made to look like moss growing on a rock all take over.  \nThe finale, as some of you will have seen, featured McMenamy emerging on to the dried leaf covered catwalk and standing there, illuminated like a Titania-esque statue with leaves falling from above.  She then looks up bewildered and lost and finds nestled under the leaves, a rope that guides her to a dramatic reveal of a woodland scene and into a curious looking hut.  \nThen there's an unexpected blaring of techno from this hidden club, to which we were all invited in to (provided you can elbow your way in through the throng of guests) afterwards for a drink or two with McMenamy revelling in all the photo snapping and looking like she owned this joint called the Core Club.  According to the receipts plastered all over the walls, there are a ton of lifetime members, perhaps an allusion to the lifelong dedicated fans of Alexander McQueen, both brand and person.  That's a Core Club that you can happily sign me up to.       \n",

      "text": "Louis Vuitton: The Secret (and not so secret) Places\nI'm quite tickled with the fact that my fashion month has been given a sense of symmetry courtesy of Louis Vuitton , who invited me out yesterday to Paris to discover a few \"secret places\" which is succinctly summarised in the video above, unlike this beast of a post that I'm typing up at 3am after freshly landing in New York.  So it is to be that Louis Vuitton will both kickstart and conclude my fashion month as of course in a month's time, in Paris in a month's time there'll be another show extravaganza as well as the opening of the new Louis Vuitton Marc Jacobs exhibition .  A dusting of snow and a stunning view from the Ritz is just the sort of insanely picturesque start that this month needs. \n…………………………………………………………………………………………..\nThe craftsmanship and heritage aspects of Louis Vuitton aren't things that are necessarily sidelined.  In fact, they're at the forefront of Louis Vuitton's marketing and advertising campaigns at times.  Remember the ad featuring a woman hand stitching a bag that got banned in the UK ?  I personally never felt like the ad was wholly deceptive and rather, it was pointing out that there are in fact \"petites mains\" involved in the hundred stage process of constructing a Louis Vuitton bag or trunk.  Now that I've witnessed these hands at work, I'm even more convinced that the ad didn't deserve to be banned.  Despite that ad glitch, the concept of savoir faire has never been more spotlit than it is now, what with Louis Vuitton's newly relaunched website that features languid videos honing in on the intricacies of process.  Specifically for Louis Vuitton, this shift in spotlighting craftsmanship is a retaliation against the counterfeit behemoth that they face.  Cynically, you could also say that it is part of the rise of exposing what goes on behind the scenes as a marketing strategy, something which I've defended in the past .  I reiterate here – as long as the show of craftsmanship is a genuine one, I see nothing wrong in how brands divulge that information.   \nOn a more personal level, my relationship with Louis Vuitton on this blog has been needlessly fractious.  From a childish rant back in 2006 where I got irritated with Hong Kong acquaintances buying up monogrammed goods like there was no tomorrow, I've come to contradict myself and lust certain ready to wear collections with gusto – namely S/S 10 and of course the current pastel takeover of S/S 12.  This post is therefore some sort of reconcilation.  I'm no longer that angry teenager that thinks fashion brands are evil fat cats or that buying a designer handbag is the downfall of mankind.  The saturation of Louis Vuitton monogrammed products is of course in no way representative of what Louis Vuitton as a brand, stands for as a whole and connecting what they do today with how Mr Louis Vuitton began in 1854 seems even more relevant as the brand looks back to their history with their upcoming exhibition. \nAlong with Kristin of The Clothes Whisperer , we ventured out to the Parisian suburb Asni√®res, where Louis Vuitton set up his workshop in 1859.  Until 1977, the Asni√®res workshop was actually the sole Louis Vuitton production facility in the world.  Louis Vuitton also added two pretty brickwork houses by the workshop, which were then lived by subsequent generations of the Vuitton family. \nSomewhere in this pic, three generations of the Vuitton family are present – Louis Vuitton, his son Georges and his son Gaston, who I believe is lying on the famous fold-out bed-in-a-trunk. \nThe only well-distributed and recognisable imagery of designer's houses/apartments are that of Coco Chanel.  A good number of bloggers, journalists and guests have now frequented the famous apartment on Rue Cambon.  This isn't the case for the Vuitton family home in Asni√®res (although I have to cite Bag Snob, who did visit the site two years ago ) so it was such a delight to step into a reception room bathed in natural light, beautiful Art Nouveau curves and to discover an individualistic decor that was outrageous at the time, but became outmoded rather quickly.  Within this beautifully preserved Belle Epoque room, features like the pistachio naturalistic curls and peach hued florals look fresh and exciting again. \nThe stained glass windows done by Paul-Louis Janin in 1900 are particularly stunning.  Not sure if LVMH have the power to command natural light but the day was pretty much spot-on weather wise in terms of seeing this room at its best situ. \nA note about the monogram, hardcore Louis Vuitton-ers will know that it wasn't actually created by Louis Vuitton nor was it the first bit of LV insignia.  The checked Damier print actually came first and then to prevent counterfeiting (oh the irony…), Georges Louis came up with the monogram in 1896. \nThe blue ceramic fireplace was also another strong feature in the room.  At this point, the inner Antiques Roadshow geek was coming out and I started to run my hands over things, whilst nearly passing ridiculous comments on how good the condition was. \nThe same can be said for this marquetry bureau.  I might need to learn some print clashing skills off it as I counted at least ten different geometric patterns, all created by intricate wood marquetry.  Our guide pointed out the faint similarities between some of the marquetry and the LV monogram, which could well have been a source of inspiration for the final iconic monogram pattern. \nI also nearly started saying things like \"Oooh!  That's a lovely period feature\", in manner of picky house hunters in London, who want period features but don't actually know what erm… period they mean.  The fluidity of the plaster stucco work gave the room a sense of movement and honestly, without wanting to sound like I'm gushing, when the light came in, it was pretty magical. \nThe little semi-circles in the stained glass windows apparently enabled taskmaster Vuitton to oversee his workers in the workshop across from the house without them being able to look inside the house.\nHere, Marc Jacobs is pictured with Patrick Vuitton, Louis Vuitton's great, great grandson, who now heads up the workshop in Asni√®res, creating special orders for customers. \nWe then went up inside the little travel museum, which has some of Vuittons' earliest flat trunk specimens.  It seems silly now that a flat top and bottomed trunk could be considered an innovation in travel but in fact, all trunks beforehand came with a rounded top (to allow for water run-off).  The museum neatly sums up the various patternations that Louis Vuitton and his son created – the brown and white stripe, the Damier check and then the famous monogram.  Another example of Oriental marquetry (I'm using the word in the stylistic sense) again reasserts an inspiration link to the inception of the monogram.   \nThis early steamer bag with its tricolor logo was recently revived and lifted as inspiration by Kim Jones in his S/S 12 debut for Louis Vuitton menswear. \nIt says a lot that as I apparoched this bit in the museum, I said \"It's the famous packaway bed!\".  It seems unlikely that a creaky old pack-away bed has become an iconic Louis Vuitton archive image, due to it being widely seen in various touring exhibitions.  I suppose it sums up the assertion that Louis Vuitton has and still is essentially a business based on travel, a practical point that sometimes gets lost when we think of Louis Vuitton and its hype-built shows, campaigns and luxurious image.\n…………………………………………………………………………………………..\nAfter the tour of the house, we then ventured into the atelier, which has been downscaled from what it once was, as it now concentrates on making all the hard framed luggage, special order pieces, exotic leather bags as well as the fashion show bags.  I'm pleased to say though that in another part of, Asni√®res Louis Vuitton are training up a new generation of people to work at Louis Vuitton's atelier, something that I vehemently believe in and support.  This workshop makes 250 special items or so a year which doesn't sound like a lot but the demand has never been higher and the dedication and time that each object requires hasn't diminished either, and so the need for new blood to come through the workshop is rightfully being addressed.\nThere was a bit of a strict policy with photographing and as the workers were also finishing up (they clock off VERY promptly at 5), I couldn't get the full scope of images that I normally do when I go to a factory/workshop.  Sadly, I couldn't follow the make of a bag from beginning to end but I guess it's testament to how many processes there are involved in the making of a bag, that I couldn't even physically follow their every single move with my camera.\nHere, carpenters are constructing the foundation boxes made out of popular and reinforced with beechwood as the basis of the luggage.  I love these handwritten dimensions, passed down from Vuitton's instructions, which haven't actually changed that much. \nIn the warm leather storage area, we got a feel for all the supple lush skins that Louis Vuitton get in for their bags and for future styles, it looks to be extremely colourful. \nThe Epi leather is probably my favourite 'iconic' Louis Vuitton leathers/finishes just because its patina is so subtle yet immediately recognisable at the same time. \nHere's a stack of that nude leather that is used to make the handles, the straps and the trims of a lot of Louis Vuitton bags.  This was one of the \"fake\" rules that I learnt about Louis Vuitton bag back – that if it's a fake, the nude leather won't colour or take on an aged patina over time. \nWe then saw the exotic skins section, where I was admonished for touching these insanely expensive pieces that would then be made up into bags.  Asni√®res is the only place where Louis Vuitton's exotic skin bags are made so I rightfully deserved to be reprimanded considering how expensive some of them are.  Here are some stingray and python skins. \nWhat I didn't know was that the shiny sheen on a croc or alligator skin is actually created by rolling an agate stone over the skin until it takes on a shine. \nAgain, we weren't allowed to take pictures but basically a leather cutting machine controlled by lasers expertly cuts the leather pieces to make up the bags and thus reduces wastage because of its accuracy.  Going back to that banned \"Handmade\" advert, it seems to me that whilst machines are used at Louis Vuitton, without the judgement and expertise of a human being, there's no way of producing the bags.  Working the laser-cutting machine and a leather sewing machine is an admirable skill in itself.  I didn't see any fully automated processes and in the latter stages especially with the saddle stitched handles and the hammering of the nails into the luggage, you end up with products that have been touched by many more human hands than mechanic probes. \nEach piece of luggage comes with a working lock and if you're lucky enough to own several pieces of luggage, you can co-ordinate the locks so that one key opens up all of them. \nThe hand-eye coordination work got especially intense when it came to the hammering and trimming the trunks.  The little nails are hammered in by hand and judged by eye to get the spacing right. \nUpstairs was where a lot of the trunks were getting finished, prepped and ready to be shipped off.  Some people were also creating the special orders that comes through the atelier.  This article here is a feature on Patrick Vuitton and talksa bout some of the weird requests that Vuitton has received ranging from an iPod and speaker case for Karl Lagerfeld, to a little leather case for someone to hold their rubber duck.  The designs, whilst far fetched do have some limitations though.  ‚ÄúI refuse to design furniture,‚Äù Patrick explains . ‚ÄúWe are in the  business of movement.  Nothing is made by our master craftsmen that  cannot be easily transported.‚Äù\nThis trunk here is therefore the maximum size Louis Vuitton can make and if it ain't got a handle on it, they're definitely not making it. \nOn a mezzanine floor where the noise level plummets to a near silence is the exotic skins atelier.  It's quiet because the level of concentration here is soaringly high.  The expense of these skins weighs heavily on the shoulders of the workers and thus the responsibility to turn out a superbly finished, finely tuned product is definitely evident. \nA small production line of Sofia Coppola for Louis Vuitton's bag in black alligator.  Yup, still looking incredibly covetable despite their unfinished state. \nHelmut Newton's image of a Crocodile Eating Ballerina from Pina Bausch's ballet in 1983 concludes these educational steps into learning about the atelier process at Louis Vuitton.  If anything, I already knew vaguely what steps were involved in the making of Vuitton products, but the pride of the workers was something that was more unexpected.  We weren't allowed to photograph their faces but they were happy to show off what they were working on, no matter how minute each step was.  I only wish I could have spent more time there before they all started clocking off.\n…………………………………………………………………………………………..\nI thought a visit to the Champs Elysee mahussive flagship store in Paris wouldn't be anything new but seeing as my last visit was back in 2006 when I came out all indignant and huffy, this time round, I got a refresher class on the store.  For a start, I missed the 20 metre high atrium where steel rods cascade down along with a flood of natural light.  I think this was built in 2007 when the store was expanded and redone by the architects Peter Marino and Eric Carlson. \nI didn't see these floating trunks along the wall on the ground floor…\nI didn't know Louis Vuitton published paperbacks of some choice classics…\nI didn't think that they'd still be reproducing the pack-away bed-in-the-trunk for the modern customer.  The store manager said \"It can be for someone who wants a bed in their garden!\"  It's definitely an intangible cloud cuckoo land when people have foldaway beds in their gardens that probably cost more than their actual bed but still, if you can afford it, why not?\nI also didn't see that the doorway is flanked by two red columns of red LV luggage as a tribute to their Chinese customers.  Yes, Chinese customers still flood into the store and buy at a rampant pace.  I don't think they're into buying up anything and everything that is monogrammed anymore.  I'm told that the Damier in fact has overtaken the monogram in the last few years as the more popular choice. \nI missed this cruise collection print which does cheesily feature a lot of postcard moments but I quite like the white tippex feel of the print. \nIn ready to wear, I also spied a pair of python culottes.  Why stop at leather culottes (i.e. my ASOS ones) when I can have ones in light python as well?  // The more discreet bag options are available at the store's made to order lounges where you can choose your leathers and linings for a bag that doesn't scream \"LV\". \nWe also got a little lesson in how to pack our luggage.  Well, how to pack Louis Vuitton luggage specifically.  I didn't learn anything especially new other than our packing guide, reminded me that I should stuff my shoes with socks and belts so that they keep their shape in the cases and also, if you're folding shirts, turn up the collars and stuff the arms with rolls of tissue paper, so they don't get creased. \nThe final part of our \"Secret Places\" tour ended at the Espace Culturel on the top floor of the store.  This part really was a secret as we weren't allowed to take pictures but it's also an art gallery that is entirely open to the walk-in public so in this sense, so this is effectively a place that everyone can enjoy. Just taking the lift designed by Olafur Eliasson is 40 seconds well spent.  You enter the lift and once the doors close, it's entirely blacked out so that you can't see a thing and your earing becomes muffled because of the padded walls.  It's a deathly quiet 40 seconds – either filled with tranquility or clastrophobia depending on the person.  I rather enjoyed it. \nIf I'm honest, I wasn't expecting such a well-curated exhibition at the Espace Culturel.  Fashion brands supporting and collaborating with the field of art isn't anything new and there's a sense of tokenism about brands that \"dabble\" in the art field.  However, Louis Vuitton hasn't been dabbling.  The Espace Culturel goes out of its way to support up and coming artists to create emphatic exhibitions that, whilst they are all themed around Louis Vuitton's moniker of travel, the resulting works are expansive in scope and execution.  The current exhibition Anichroes explores the musical instrument and its impact first as an object and vehicle of sound all by itself, then as a discourse of interaction with the player.  It's all intriguing and interactive and again I could have spent longer.  As an art space in its own right, it's definitely worth escaping the doldrum of Champ Elysee and losing yourself for a moment on the way up. \n",

      "text": "I'm quite tickled with the fact that my fashion month has been given a sense of symmetry courtesy of Louis Vuitton, who invited me out yesterday to Paris to discover a few \"secret places\" which is succinctly summarised in the video above, unlike this beast of a post that I'm typing up at 3am after freshly landing in New York.  So it is to be that Louis Vuitton will both kickstart and conclude my fashion month as of course in a month's time, in Paris in a month's time there'll be another show extravaganza as well as the opening of the new Louis Vuitton Marc Jacobs exhibition.  A dusting of snow and a stunning view from the Ritz is just the sort of insanely picturesque start that this month needs. \n…………………………………………………………………………………………..\nThe craftsmanship and heritage aspects of Louis Vuitton aren't things that are necessarily sidelined.  In fact, they're at the forefront of Louis Vuitton's marketing and advertising campaigns at times.  Remember the ad featuring a woman hand stitching a bag that got banned in the UK?  I personally never felt like the ad was wholly deceptive and rather, it was pointing out that there are in fact \"petites mains\" involved in the hundred stage process of constructing a Louis Vuitton bag or trunk.  Now that I've witnessed these hands at work, I'm even more convinced that the ad didn't deserve to be banned.  Despite that ad glitch, the concept of savoir faire has never been more spotlit than it is now, what with Louis Vuitton's newly relaunched website that features languid videos honing in on the intricacies of process.  Specifically for Louis Vuitton, this shift in spotlighting craftsmanship is a retaliation against the counterfeit behemoth that they face.  Cynically, you could also say that it is part of the rise of exposing what goes on behind the scenes as a marketing strategy, something which I've defended in the past.  I reiterate here – as long as the show of craftsmanship is a genuine one, I see nothing wrong in how brands divulge that information.   \nOn a more personal level, my relationship with Louis Vuitton on this blog has been needlessly fractious.  From a childish rant back in 2006where I got irritated with Hong Kong acquaintances buying up monogrammed goods like there was no tomorrow, I've come to contradict myself and lust certain ready to wear collections with gusto – namely S/S 10 and of course the current pastel takeover of S/S 12.  This post is therefore some sort of reconcilation.  I'm no longer that angry teenager that thinks fashion brands are evil fat cats or that buying a designer handbag is the downfall of mankind.  The saturation of Louis Vuitton monogrammed products is of course in no way representative of what Louis Vuitton as a brand, stands for as a whole and connecting what they do today with how Mr Louis Vuitton began in 1854 seems even more relevant as the brand looks back to their history with their upcoming exhibition. \nAlong with Kristin of The Clothes Whisperer, we ventured out to the Parisian suburb Asni√®res, where Louis Vuitton set up his workshop in 1859.  Until 1977, the Asni√®res workshop was actually the sole Louis Vuitton production facility in the world.  Louis Vuitton also added two pretty brickwork houses by the workshop, which were then lived by subsequent generations of the Vuitton family. \nSomewhere in this pic, three generations of the Vuitton family are present – Louis Vuitton, his son Georges and his son Gaston, who I believe is lying on the famous fold-out bed-in-a-trunk. \nThe only well-distributed and recognisable imagery of designer's houses/apartments are that of Coco Chanel.  A good number of bloggers, journalists and guests have now frequented the famous apartment on Rue Cambon.  This isn't the case for the Vuitton family home in Asni√®res (although I have to cite Bag Snob, who did visit the site two years ago) so it was such a delight to step into a reception room bathed in natural light, beautiful Art Nouveau curves and to discover an individualistic decor that was outrageous at the time, but became outmoded rather quickly.  Within this beautifully preserved Belle Epoque room, features like the pistachio naturalistic curls and peach hued florals look fresh and exciting again. \nThe stained glass windows done by Paul-Louis Janin in 1900 are particularly stunning.  Not sure if LVMH have the power to command natural light but the day was pretty much spot-on weather wise in terms of seeing this room at its best situ. \nA note about the monogram, hardcore Louis Vuitton-ers will know that it wasn't actually created by Louis Vuitton nor was it the first bit of LV insignia.  The checked Damier print actually came first and then to prevent counterfeiting (oh the irony…), Georges Louis came up with the monogram in 1896. \nThe blue ceramic fireplace was also another strong feature in the room.  At this point, the inner Antiques Roadshow geek was coming out and I started to run my hands over things, whilst nearly passing ridiculous comments on how good the condition was. \nThe same can be said for this marquetry bureau.  I might need to learn some print clashing skills off it as I counted at least ten different geometric patterns, all created by intricate wood marquetry.  Our guide pointed out the faint similarities between some of the marquetry and the LV monogram, which could well have been a source of inspiration for the final iconic monogram pattern. \nI also nearly started saying things like \"Oooh!  That's a lovely period feature\", in manner of picky house hunters in London, who want period features but don't actually know what erm… period they mean.  The fluidity of the plaster stucco work gave the room a sense of movement and honestly, without wanting to sound like I'm gushing, when the light came in, it was pretty magical. \nThe little semi-circles in the stained glass windows apparently enabled taskmaster Vuitton to oversee his workers in the workshop across from the house without them being able to look inside the house.\nHere, Marc Jacobs is pictured with Patrick Vuitton, Louis Vuitton's great, great grandson, who now heads up the workshop in Asni√®res, creating special orders for customers. \nWe then went up inside the little travel museum, which has some of Vuittons' earliest flat trunk specimens.  It seems silly now that a flat top and bottomed trunk could be considered an innovation in travel but in fact, all trunks beforehand came with a rounded top (to allow for water run-off).  The museum neatly sums up the various patternations that Louis Vuitton and his son created – the brown and white stripe, the Damier check and then the famous monogram.  Another example of Oriental marquetry (I'm using the word in the stylistic sense) again reasserts an inspiration link to the inception of the monogram.   \nThis early steamer bag with its tricolor logo was recently revived and lifted as inspiration by Kim Jones in his S/S 12 debut for Louis Vuitton menswear. \nIt says a lot that as I apparoched this bit in the museum, I said \"It's the famous packaway bed!\".  It seems unlikely that a creaky old pack-away bed has become an iconic Louis Vuitton archive image, due to it being widely seen in various touring exhibitions.  I suppose it sums up the assertion that Louis Vuitton has and still is essentially a business based on travel, a practical point that sometimes gets lost when we think of Louis Vuitton and its hype-built shows, campaigns and luxurious image.\n…………………………………………………………………………………………..\nAfter the tour of the house, we then ventured into the atelier, which has been downscaled from what it once was, as it now concentrates on making all the hard framed luggage, special order pieces, exotic leather bags as well as the fashion show bags.  I'm pleased to say though that in another part of, Asni√®res Louis Vuitton are training up a new generation of people to work at Louis Vuitton's atelier, something that I vehemently believe in and support.  This workshop makes 250 special items or so a year which doesn't sound like a lot but the demand has never been higher and the dedication and time that each object requires hasn't diminished either, and so the need for new blood to come through the workshop is rightfully being addressed.\nThere was a bit of a strict policy with photographing and as the workers were also finishing up (they clock off VERY promptly at 5), I couldn't get the full scope of images that I normally do when I go to a factory/workshop.  Sadly, I couldn't follow the make of a bag from beginning to end but I guess it's testament to how many processes there are involved in the making of a bag, that I couldn't even physically follow their every single move with my camera.\nHere, carpenters are constructing the foundation boxes made out of popular and reinforced with beechwood as the basis of the luggage.  I love these handwritten dimensions, passed down from Vuitton's instructions, which haven't actually changed that much. \nIn the warm leather storage area, we got a feel for all the supple lush skins that Louis Vuitton get in for their bags and for future styles, it looks to be extremely colourful. \nThe Epi leather is probably my favourite 'iconic' Louis Vuitton leathers/finishes just because its patina is so subtle yet immediately recognisable at the same time. \nHere's a stack of that nude leather that is used to make the handles, the straps and the trims of a lot of Louis Vuitton bags.  This was one of the \"fake\" rules that I learnt about Louis Vuitton bag back – that if it's a fake, the nude leather won't colour or take on an aged patina over time. \nWe then saw the exotic skins section, where I was admonished for touching these insanely expensive pieces that would then be made up into bags.  Asni√®res is the only place where Louis Vuitton's exotic skin bags are made so I rightfully deserved to be reprimanded considering how expensive some of them are.  Here are some stingray and python skins. \nWhat I didn't know was that the shiny sheen on a croc or alligator skin is actually created by rolling an agate stone over the skin until it takes on a shine. \nAgain, we weren't allowed to take pictures but basically a leather cutting machine controlled by lasers expertly cuts the leather pieces to make up the bags and thus reduces wastage because of its accuracy.  Going back to that banned \"Handmade\" advert, it seems to me that whilst machines are used at Louis Vuitton, without the judgement and expertise of a human being, there's no way of producing the bags.  Working the laser-cutting machine and a leather sewing machine is an admirable skill in itself.  I didn't see any fully automated processes and in the latter stages especially with the saddle stitched handles and the hammering of the nails into the luggage, you end up with products that have been touched by many more human hands than mechanic probes. \nEach piece of luggage comes with a working lock and if you're lucky enough to own several pieces of luggage, you can co-ordinate the locks so that one key opens up all of them. \nThe hand-eye coordination work got especially intense when it came to the hammering and trimming the trunks.  The little nails are hammered in by hand and judged by eye to get the spacing right. \nUpstairs was where a lot of the trunks were getting finished, prepped and ready to be shipped off.  Some people were also creating the special orders that comes through the atelier.  This article here is a feature on Patrick Vuitton and talksa bout some of the weird requests that Vuitton has received ranging from an iPod and speaker case for Karl Lagerfeld, to a little leather case for someone to hold their rubber duck.  The designs, whilst far fetched do have some limitations though.  ‚ÄúI refuse to design furniture,‚Äù Patrick explains. ‚ÄúWe are in the business of movement.  Nothing is made by our master craftsmen that cannot be easily transported.‚Äù\nThis trunk here is therefore the maximum size Louis Vuitton can make and if it ain't got a handle on it, they're definitely not making it. \nOn a mezzanine floor where the noise level plummets to a near silence is the exotic skins atelier.  It's quiet because the level of concentration here is soaringly high.  The expense of these skins weighs heavily on the shoulders of the workers and thus the responsibility to turn out a superbly finished, finely tuned product is definitely evident. \nA small production line of Sofia Coppola for Louis Vuitton's bag in black alligator.  Yup, still looking incredibly covetable despite their unfinished state. \nHelmut Newton's image of a Crocodile Eating Ballerina from Pina Bausch's ballet in 1983 concludes these educational steps into learning about the atelier process at Louis Vuitton.  If anything, I already knew vaguely what steps were involved in the making of Vuitton products, but the pride of the workers was something that was more unexpected.  We weren't allowed to photograph their faces but they were happy to show off what they were working on, no matter how minute each step was.  I only wish I could have spent more time there before they all started clocking off.\n…………………………………………………………………………………………..\nI thought a visit to the Champs Elysee mahussive flagship store in Paris wouldn't be anything new but seeing as my last visit was back in 2006 when I came out all indignant and huffy, this time round, I got a refresher class on the store.

      "text": "MA Kick Off\nLondon College of Fashion kicks off the year of MA/BA shows with names, names and more names to vaguely remember for the future.  Though it's like that it's the ideas, a particular motifs or a technique that lingers longer in memory.  LCF's MA exhibition at Bloomsbury House, showcasing the final projects of the fashion artefact, digital fashion, fashion curation and footwear to name but a few, just gets bigger and better, year on year.  So much so, that I've had to split out my posts on both the exhibition at the MA show which was held once again at the V&A's Raphael Hall last Thursday .  I'll kick off with fashion artefact and footwear design, the part of the exhibition that was particularly impressive not only because the designs left an impression but also that they had real sustainable legs.  You forgot that these were MA graduate projects but looked at them as though they were viable products, ready to go to market and that was the case for a lot of the students anyway which makes it doubly exciting to watch out for.  \n…………………………………………………………………………………………..\nRuth Holland (MA Fashion Artefact)\nThe upcycling concept of putting rubbish to good use isn't anything new but you would never guess that Ruth Holland's pastel hued neck confectionary was made out of industrial waste materials.  String and plastic cording find their way into multi-coloured configurations that are twisted together with traditional rope-making techniques.  It's the delicious application of colour that really transforms this waste into something special.  \n…………………………………………………………………………………………..\nLinda Holten Ramsvik  (MA Fashion Artefact)\nLCF has seen some real travel bag gems come through in the last few years such as Sarah Williams and her unexpectedly cuved handmade luggage .  Linda Holten Ramsvik looks to add herself to that category with her final project that was inspired by travelling and the multi-purpose needs for the modern day bag carrier.  Proving her point, I myself was carrying a heavy DSLR, a leather tote bag and a smaller handbag.  Her creations here negates that need with her two or even three in one bags.  Safari waistcoats come with a hood and huge pockets.  A sunglasses carrier holds four glasses.  A granny grocery trolley gets a neat transformation into something sleek (I secretly wish I could get away with a granny trolley, what with my weak wrists).  Texture in the form of deconstructed Norwegian embroidery prevents the line-up from looking too flat.  \n…………………………………………………………………………………………..\nHoon Chung  (MA Fashion Footwear)\n3D printing is slowly cropping up in fashion in a way that means anytime soon, I'm going to have to go and see it for myself because I still can't quite believe that a 3D object with facets, curves and highly specific shapes can be printed out.  The very word print throws me off entirely.  Hoon Chung's 3D printed shoes opens up the eyes to the possibility of a pair of shoes coming out of a \"printer\".  They're very much in line with the sort of thoughtful innovation that the likes of Helen Furber worked on when she was at LCF , rethinking the traditional shoe makine process and pushing the field forward  into an unpredictable place.  \n…………………………………………………………………………………………..\nAnne Gammelgaard (MA Fashion Artefact)\nNot every graduate approached their final project with the goal to put out a commercial collection of products.  Anne Gammelgaard based her artefact design on a character – a  thing-finder rooting through a post-apocalyptic scenario to create instruments that will aid her on her special mission.  It's as if Gammelgaard is writing a film and creating the props for it with complete conviction.  As per her character's story, all the materials are found which shows the breadth of what upcycling can really do.  \n…………………………………………………………………………………………..\nCat Potter (MA Fashion Footwear)\nCat Potter's wooden \"shoes\" landed in my inbox a while back and they got me salivated for the exhibition if her peers were going to be anywhere near as focused as her collection.  Working with University College London and their 3-axis milling machines, normally used in architecture to create much larger scale building components, Cat wanted to bypass the conventional shoe components and create an object out of wood that would gradually build up from a rectangular block to a more shoe-like sandal shape.  Functionality wasn't the goal here as Cat wanted to explore an entirely alternative mode of construction.  Blending in furniture and architecture into footwear isn't entirely new but it's interesting that these \"shoes\" take the methodology behind those aforementioned fields  and applies them to footwear.  It's an extreme that can really only be appreciated when you see Cat's future work which hopefully we will see more of.\n \nChristina Hamilton (MA Fashion Artefact)\nIf I had passed Christina Hamilton's work a year ago, I might not have been as interested in her saddlery led bike accessories.  The Tweed Run experience of last year and the fact that Steve has just got himself a handsome new bike makes Christina's work suddenly all the more relevant.  Not that she needs fairweather cyclists like myself.  Whether it's down to Boris bikes or not, London is a cyclist-heavy city and handsome accessories that don't sacrifice aesthetic for functionality will only become higher in demand.  Christina hopes to develop a business out of her leather bike wares that are made using traditional saddlery techniques and on the bikes at the exhibition, her pieces already looked like they were ready to hit the road.      \n…………………………………………………………………………………………..\nChi Yuen (MA Fashion Footwear)\nI actually met Chi (also called Cherry) back in 2008 in San Francisco as part of the Arts of Fashion competition.  She was doing womenswear back then but has refocused on footwear and has since gained work experience at the likes of Celine and Alexander Wang.  Her graduate collection is really geared towards launching a solo brand .  The warped and draped leather as well as the ruching of fur are unexpected details in this highly polished collection.  These extremities are tempered enough to the point where you can already see them walking down the street, a recurring theme with a lot of the MA Fashion Artefacts/Footwear graduates.    \n…………………………………………………………………………………………..\nJen Wang (MA Fashion Artefact)\nI was trying to rack my brains to see whether previous LCF fashion artefacts students had done sunglasses and in fact Jen Wang is the first one to do it.  It was also the first time I'd ever tried on anything at a graduate exhibition which made the reality of Jen Wang bringing these glasses to production, all the more appealing.  Based on bipolar personalities and the sunglasses as a face-changer, these highly complex designs really put Wang's sunglasses in a different league from the bulk of standardised frames that exist.  Designers sunglasses so often rely on the strength of a brand or a logo and Jen Wang really opens up the opportunties of pushing sunnies to becoming the central focus rather than the tack-on accessory.  Incidentally, it was also in China that Jen made these exquisite sunglasses, which sheds light on how the Made in China label will inevitably change in the future.  Another Wang to add into the fashion fold would be no bad thing if we were able to get our mitts on sunglasses of this ilk.  \n",

Christina hopes to develop a business out of her leather bike wares that are made using traditional saddlery techniques and on the bikes at the exhibition, her pieces already looked like they were ready to hit the road.      \n…………………………………………………………………………………………..\nChi Yuen (MA Fashion Footwear)\nI actually met Chi (also called Cherry) back in 2008 in San Francisco as part of the Arts of Fashion competition.  She was doing womenswear back then but has refocused on footwear and has since gained work experience at the likes of Celine and Alexander Wang.  Her graduate collection is really geared towards launching a solo brand.  The warped and draped leather as well as the ruching of fur are unexpected details in this highly polished collection.  These extremities are tempered enough to the point where you can already see them walking down the street, a recurring theme with a lot of the MA Fashion Artefacts/Footwear graduates.    \n…………………………………………………………………………………………..\nJen Wang (MA Fashion Artefact)\nI was trying to rack my brains to see whether previous LCF fashion artefacts students had done sunglasses and in fact Jen Wang is the first one to do it.  It was also the first time I'd ever tried on anything at a graduate exhibition which made the reality of Jen Wang bringing these glasses to production, all the more appealing.  Based on bipolar personalities and the sunglasses as a face-changer, these highly complex designs really put Wang's sunglasses in a different league from the bulk of standardised frames that exist.  Designers sunglasses so often rely on the strength of a brand or a logo and Jen Wang really opens up the opportunties of pushing sunnies to becoming the central focus rather than the tack-on accessory.  Incidentally, it was also in China that Jen made these exquisite sunglasses, which sheds light on how the Made in China label will inevitably change in the future.  Another Wang to add into the fashion fold would be no bad thing if we were able to get our mitts on sunglasses of this ilk.  \n",

      "text": "Made Abroad\nThere were two awesome parties going on Saturday night.  One was down in my hotel lobby at the Tribeca Grand.  The other was in my head, a continual buzz of high after seeing a trio that had transplanted themselves to Milk Made.\nFor those not familiar with New York Fashion Week's schedule structure.  Basically you have all the razzy dazzy shows up at the Lincoln Centre, a scattering of them dotted around galleries in Chelsea, a few off site shows in wildly downtown/uptown locations and then a concentration of cool happening at Milk Studios, what was formerly known as Mac Milk is now rebranded as Milk Made schedule .  It's also the place where I happen to spend most of my NYFW week because season after season, they welcome up and coming designers into their fold and provide them with the infrastructure to put on a show or a presentation.  You end up with a mix of semi-established, up and coming as well as static accessories designers showing their wares.  It's a lot of bang for your buck basically.   \nOn Saturday, Milk Made welcomed two new designers into their circle, both from out of town, not that it matters a jot.  This is New York of course, city of opportunity and new beginnings.  Calla from Paris (originally from Canada), Ostwald Helgason from London (originally from Iceland and Germany) join Dean Quinn , ex-resident of London (originally from Ireland) to form a trio of out-of-towners that together made my night.  Search all of them on the sidebar to the right, and ye will find multiple posts on all of them dating back to the early days of Style Bubble when images were a lot smaller and words peppered with one too many exclamation mark. \nStill, I feel like reverting to bad habits!!!!!!!!  I was well and truly excited to see all of them evolve and excite the crowd in New York.  The openness of the presentations basically means anybody who's vaguely interested can walk in and check it out, so there was a lot of raw enthusiasm with people bouncing from one room to the other on the eight floor. \n…………………………………………………………………………………………..\nFirst up was Calla , whose feminine and abstracted digital prints I've always had a soft spot for.  She hasn't strayed too far from that territory and if anything the Leith Clark's styling accentuated the girlish charm of Calla Haynes's print work which this season distorted wood grains and granite flecks so that they almost looked like florals from afar or torrid ink blots on wet paper.  The wood grain background in the set, which also looked like a silk moire (a fabric which she has successfully used in the past) really boosted the static presentation and made you want to step right into this candy pink corner, mixing and matching Calla's prints.  They work in tandem with one another or as solid monochramtic print too and with simple dresses, trousers and covetable items like a shearling biker jacket, adding to Calla's signature built-in bustier dress, this was a more than competent \"Hello\" to the New York crowd. \n…………………………………………………………………………………………..\nArguably, Dean Quinn's presentation caused the most fuss with the least number of silhouettes.  Thirteen dresses that have reduced his eye from detailing from the overt to the subtle (see my early posts of Dean Quinn's graduate work and you shall find a giant leap from then and now).  Zippers were the central motif here and gave the silk crepe dresses an energy, to take away any notions of mere red carpet material (although, I'm sure Quinn's work will find their way on to some starlet or another soon).  Apparently, his S/S 12 collection has been flying off the racks in Barneys.  This might have something to do with his smart pricing with nothing bieng over $1,000.  That's pretty much a reasonable price when it comes to high-end designer dress leagues.  I'm only slightly disappointed that his breakout didn't occur in London but still, New York have welcome him with open arms and it's working for him so I can only see an onward and upward rise from here on end. \n…………………………………………………………………………………………..\nOstwald Helgason are new to the Milk Made schedule and made a banging start with what I think is their best presentation yet.  Their collections that are shown at the London Fashion Week exhibition have been quietly gaining momentum, picking up stockists like Opening Ceremony.  I've already logged in a huge personal order for S/S 12 just because they seem to pick up on the oddest textural detailing and motifs.  Last season it was cork and laminated dried hydrangeas.  This season, it's nautical stripes and sea monsters.  Looking at old antique maps and Nordic seafaring tales, Susanne Helgason and Invgar Ostwald honed in on the nautical stripe and spliced them into neat little shifts and flared hem skirts, adding unexpected colours that you might not associate with the oft-used nautical theme.  The sea monsters appeared as an illustration on sweatshirts and some seriously covetable knitwear bulked out this precise collection.  The waffle knits did have a Jonathan Saunders feel to them except the duo used effective colour combinations that really make them the sort of winter warmers that you'd wear over and over again. \n",
